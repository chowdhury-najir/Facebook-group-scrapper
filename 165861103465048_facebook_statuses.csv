Over all they were creamy, fresh and all the ingredients went well together. Were they exceptional? No. Would I go again to eat them? Yes   \nrating: 4/5\n\nThe chipotle fries were good but not better then the pizza fries in my Opinion, though I did love the chipotle sauce on them.\n3.4/5\n\nThe pizza's were average, nothing that stood out among other pizza's I have tried. The mustard sauce on buffalo chicken pizza didn't go well with the other flavours in it, it simply didn't work for me. 2.5-3ish/5\n\nWe had mixed reviews on the beef lasagne. My friend hated it while I liked it alot. It had a mild flavour ( again I think it would have been alot better with marinara). For me it was 3.5/5\n\nOn to the service. Very disappointing. The restaurant was a small place, even though full it was nothing 3-4 waiter's couldn't handle but still the service was extremely slow. The waiter's either did their best to make sure no eye contact was made with the customers or simply looked away when called. When they finally came, each time whatever I asked for was either forgotten ( had to ask someone else about it again till I got it) or just took way too long. The food service being slow is something excusable but why did it take so long to bring the drinks after serving the food? And more still to bring a bottle of water ( all this the waiter was standing 2 feet away, idle) which was ordered with the food. \nBeing a foodie, maybe I am just used to 5 star service and the bar is set too high.\n \nWould I go again? Probably not, bad service really ruins the experience, especially since so many other options are Available with equally good food and much much faster service. If the service gets improved, the place is decent.""",b'Amna Khalid',"b""Photos from Amna Khalid's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1577500815701944&set=gm.1834376376613504&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1834376376613504/',2018-03-03 15:30:09,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

I love to explore new flavours and I've noticed that usually shawarma has a typical flavour at every place. Fortunately, you can try different types of shawarmas here. :D\nOkay, so I liked Kolachi more as compared to Original Beiruti. Both were scrumptious and juicy, they were filled with enormous amount of meat. \nOriginal Beiruti had a filling of meat, fries, pickles and of course, their special delicious sauce. \nKolachi had a filling of meat, onions, tomatoes and their special sauce to enhance the flavour. \nMoreover, another good thing about their shawarma is that they wrapped it up in flatbread instead of pita bread.

It was our anniversary and I wanted to make it extra special for my wifey. Keeping in mind, we are both prawn and fish lovers, we went to the festival at Asia live and man, we were so full and super happy when we got done there. \nStarted off with soup seafood bisque, which had a very balanced flavour and totally geared us up for what was coming our way. Appetisers main, our personal favourite were the saffron prawns as they were fried and just so crisp, we couldn't have enough of them!\nThe salad bar was a delight to even look at, so many colours and a galore of various textures and flavours! From prawn lettuce wraps to dynamite prawns;assorted cheese to crab salad- everything was not only tempting but way too delicious. But kitna khaatay? Main course was left! \nIn desi, my personal favourite was the fish biryani! Just the way we love it! Other than that, brilliantly made crab yellow curry reminded me of some of the best Thai restaurants I've visited. Fish on skewers had a unique taste to it, pan fried tuna steak was light and so refreshing! My wife likes Italian so she loveddd pasta marinara. Not to forget, there was a variety of fish to choose from and they made spicy red snapper there and then for me. \nDesserts were heaven melting in mouth like always but the best was their blueberry cheesecake! \nWonderful experience in all, I would give 10/10 as it was not only yummy but their service is awesome and we were absolutely content by the end of it!""",b'Aly Azghar Naqvi',"b""Photos from Aly Azghar Naqvi's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156106728428808&set=gm.1834220083295800&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1834220083295800/',2018-03-03 11:30:59,8,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0

So we actually risked to try different things like\nTokyo scalian rice bowl mentioned on the menu that it was a japanese dish. Well it was just enough soya sauce-y for me didnt mind the taste at all. It had baby corns in it too! The  garlicky flavor was popping out.\nThe well known mongolian chicken *for the safe side* kuch aisa bhi manga lia jis ko jantay hon :p\nIt was yummmyyy!!! Thats all id say! \nAnd lastly for the mains we had thai styled chicken with the aromatic basil. It had a mild flavor with fragnance of chillies basil and garlic. Salty flavor perhaps maybe because of soy sauce and it was served with jasmine rice. A complete meal deal.\nFor the love of nutella we had nutella wontons. They were served with a scoop of icecream. Though I liked the rasberry cheese cake because of its blastic salty sour and sweet flavors! \nThis journey of trying all asian cuisine went good!

165861103465048_1799739226743886,"b""I recently paid a visit to Market - Modern Asian Kitchen with a few friends. It is a nice cosy restaurant located in Bukhari commercial near chotu chai wala. After looking at the menu I could see why they named it market because a lot of the items on their menu gave that 'asian street food' kinda vibe, which is right up my alley!\n\nWe started with loaded kimchi fries, steamed shrimp dumplings in chilli oil and chicken satay with spicy peanut sauce. The fries were an absolute winner for me! Fully loaded with shredded Korean beef, cheese and kimchi. It was truly a party in my mouth. \nThis was my first experience with dumplings and I'm totally addicted. The dumplings were cooked to perfection and that chilli oil really brought the whole dish together.\n\nFrom the sushi menu we tried the fire roll, paradise roll and the Karachi roll (crispy California). The sushi tasted really fresh and completely melted in the month. Compared to other sushi places their price is really economical for the food and quantity they provide. \n\nFrom the mains we tried the fire cracker chicken with jasmine rice, Korean fried chicken sliders with spicy gochujang sauce and steamed bao buns. All 3 mains were outstanding especially the Korean sliders, the fried chicken in it was so so crispy! And that spicy sauce really complemented the sliders. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the crying chocolate. I'm a meetha freak and for me it hit all the right spots. It wasn't too sweet because of the unsweetened cocoa powder sprinkled on top. It was served with vanilla ice cream and the whole plate was wiped clean in under 10 seconds. \n\nI would also like to mention that the staff was really friendly and the service was spot on. So if you're in the mood for a modern twist on asian street food, you know where to go :)""",b'Natasha Arif',"b""Photos from Natasha Arif's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214228108269342&set=gm.1799739226743886&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1799739226743886/',2018-01-29 15:25:25,53,19,12,47,6,0,0,0,0

Usually boiled chicken used in ramen but they have used grilled chicken with sauce on it. Overall noodles, chicken, mushroom and veges complimenting each other to make a good combination. \n\n2- Fire Cracker Chicken\n\nSpicy chicken cubes with brown rice, though this dish was common but was soothing with rice. Suggestion add little gravy to it. \n\n3- Black pepper Beef\n\nThis was again common dish, as many other restaurants are playing well with pepper beef. \nAlthough beef was tender and onions were complimenting the over all taste of the dish. \n\n4- Fried Ice Cream \n\nMy all time favourite dessert dish, vanilla flavour ice cream scoop dipped with nuts and fried, topped with chocolate liquid. \n\nTotal damage including 3 drinks, 2700pkr.""",b'Saad Qamar Bhatti',"b""Photos from Saad Qamar Bhatti's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155352867921033&set=gm.1817819974935811&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1817819974935811/',2018-02-16 06:24:40,127,27,2,118,3,5,1,0,0

165861103465048_1833168210067654,"b""Rant against foodpanda and BurgerLab:\nMy colleagues and I placed an order through foodpanda for BurgerLab today. The online order was placed somewhat around 12 or 12:15 PM. When the foodpanda representative called to confirm, due to some misunderstanding the order was cancelled. I immediately wrote to their online support to confirm the order, I even asked if they would confirm it like this or would I have to re-order. As seen from the screenshots, their representative confirmed the order and ensured it would be delivered by 1:24 PM.\nAn hour over their designated time, I inquired again only to find that they had confused another order which was also placed from our office through foodpanda for Chop Chop Wok and considered our BurgerLab order as delivered (despite my mentioning our BurgerLab order no#). The foodpanda representative called and proposed that I place an order AGAIN (this was at 2:30 PM). \nI didn't take the risk of an online order this time and directly called foodpanda and placed my order. I requested them to deliver the order as soon as possible as everyone was SUPER HUNGRY by that time. They assured they will. Our order arrived at 4:15 PM. We were STARVED. The cherry on top was that the order was WRONG (also the burgers were cold and the fries were stale and rubbery). We called BurgerLab to complain, they said they'll listen to the call recording of our order and get back to us. They called 10 minutes later and admitted their mistake, their representative mistakenly told us of a different flavor (Big Bang) which was not part of the deal we ordered. They said they'll send us the order we want but they'll deduct the bill from their representative's salary (the one who handled our order). We said we didn't want that (who would have a meal at the cost of a poor man's salary?).\nBottom line is that the service we got from both foodpanda and BurgerLab was extremely poor. Foodpanda was irresponsible (didn't bother to check our order no# and confused the order only to let us know too late that it was cancelled) whereas BurgerLab shamelessly played the guilt card. \nMoney- ruined\nMood- ruined\nAppetite- ruined\nTHANKS A BUNCH! #Foodpanda #BurgerLab""",b'Urooj Sheikh',"b""Photos from Urooj Sheikh's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204671640226976&set=gm.1833168210067654&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1833168210067654/',2018-03-02 11:41:19,18,3,0,14,0,0,1,0,3

I visited Burger Lab SMCHS Branch last night along with 2 friends and decided to order 3 firehouse burgers with drink and fries. I had to pay the bill by my UBL card for availing 15% discount and I was also out of cash but surprisingly they said our card machine is out of order. Then, I went outside, drew the amount from ATM and paid for order. After a long waiting of 40 mints what we got, the burgers were cold and fries were oily.

It was a messy eat though and you'd better have napkins nearby when trying these \xf0\x9f\x98\x89\n\nCottage Fries were the regular cheese fries we get anywhere else whereas Beast Fries were topped with minced meat, jalapenos and olives! \n\nMac N Cheese Bunless Burger: \nNot something I had looked forward to. I felt there was room for improvement in both the Mac N Cheese and the beef patty. The beef could've had been juicier. But whoever likes this combination will probably love it.\n\nJalapeno Royale wasn't as good as I had expected. The Jalapeno sauce overpowered the taste of beef. \n\nGooey Bleu was my favourite among the four I tried. The chicken was tender and flavoursome, and cheese oozed at every bite. \n\nPortland Winner: The beef patty could've been a bit more juicy otherwise it was good.

The little serving of the spicy kimchi-like veggies was unique.\nWe ordered a family bowl of their Hot & Sour soup. The serving was enough for a total of 8 people. We requested them to reheat the leftover soup and serve it later when the rest of the people arrive and they were courteous enough to do so. The soup had generous amount of vegetables and seasonings but it wasn't 'hot' enough.  \nWe a ordered a total of 4 main courses. \nChicken Sriracha-Was moderately spicy.\nCherry Chicken- Boneless chicken pieces in a toothsome sweet and tangy sauce.\nPrawns with Chilli Sauce- The star of the show for me. Perfectly cooked fresh prawns in a spicy sauce with saut\xc3\xa8ed onions. \nThe rice bowls- They were all fresh and perfectly seasoned rice. You get free refills so at Shisi you don't have to worry about the quantity of rice. \nChicken Chowmein- Made up of normal spaghetti instead of egg noodles. They were generous with the protein and the vegetables.\n\nFor desert they had the choice of nutella and/or fudge cake. \n\nBefore we left, the manager came and inquired about our experience. \n\nOverall a 4.5 star experience. The prices are reasonable.\n\nScream-\nLocated right next to Shisi at SMCHS. Even though we loved the Ice-Creams and the Boba Ice Teas, I would say that the place was over priced. \nWe tried their freshly frozen peach,mango and chocolate flavour for 250/- each. Even though the quantity was less but the quality wasn't compromised. \nNow the Boba Iced Tea. \nThe menu stated that the Boba Iced Tea was priced at Rs.250/-. We ordered Lychee/Blueberry and PineApple/Blueberry. \nThe iced tea was the right temperature and full of flavour. \nThe Bobas are tiny balls full of the flavour you choose.

The cheese balls were a cherry on the top filled with huge amounts of cheese, this special was just outstanding.\nPrice: Pkr 847\n\n#StuffedChickenSteak: badumtusshhhh, hands down I'm in love. Tender chicken stuffed with creamy cheese topped with feta cheese and served with a sideline of fries, this one was an explosion of the taste buds if you're a cheese lover. Loved it.\nPrice: Pkr 725\n\nService and Ambiance: Well the customer service as usual was spot on, we used our Vouch365 for the order and our koffie chalet reward card.

When my burger arrived on my table I immediately called waiter that to ask what the hell is this and in between their owner came, I asked him a similar question that what is wrong with your serving size and he replied ' ye wohi bun hai Jo apko McDonald ma milta hai' bilkul swag mein kahky Bhai Sahab chaldiye and I realized k paisy to denay hi hai to chalo khalo.

The place was compact and there was no sitting arrangement in the waiting area (Actually there was no waiting area either, we had to stand at the entrance while waiting). \nWe had to wait for 45 minutes before we got a spot. After that, nobody was there to serve us for at least 15 minutes. We kept calling the waiters/managers but no one showed up. A waiter came after 15 minutes, we asked him to guide us about some of the dishes in the menu. Unfortunately, the didn't know anything and took a while to read the description as he was clueless. \n\nNow coming to the food:\nWe ordered:\n1. Deep dish pizza: Wasn't what we had expected. The crust on the boundary and the base of the pizza, was too thick. NOT RECOMMENDED!\n2. Dry chicken chilli: It was really spicy as there was a bunch of green chillies. \n3. Sandwich: didn't like the taste.\n4. Fettuccine alfredo: It was bearable.\n5. Strawberry lemonade: Regret ordering it, it was rather a strawberry slush.\n\nTo our surprise, they didn't even pack the left over pizza for us. Everything else was there but no pizza (There was more than a slice left)\n\nQuantity: The serving was extremely less and disappointing. Each dish would serve approximately only one person. \nTaste: It was okay-ish.\nService: PATHETIC!\n\nWe had two vouchers of Vouch365, through which we planned to avail 100% free servings of Penne Marinara and beef chilli dry, but instead, they provided 99% discount and charged us 1% for the free items.\n\nConclusion:\nThe place is overpriced and over-hyped.

Oooh yeah! \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e Almost everything a burger fanatic wants, \xe2\x9c\x8b\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbbOH WAIT! I forgot to mention the fancy bun that gives it a really BADASS look.

165861103465048_1681086575275819,"b""I went to Zauq located in Dolmen Mall Clifton yesterday to try their newly launched Hi Tea Buffet\nI visited zauq back in Ramadan for iftaar and really loved the food which is why I just had to come back to try the hi tea. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had set up a whole area for a birthday party in the restaurant (a fully decorated space which looked amazeballs- had no idea they do these sorts of arrangements).\nAnyway I tried the hot n sour soup, Kachori with aloo (pls tell me the correct name for this bhujia sort of thing), pasta, Fried rice, chicken manchurian, fried fish, shawarma roll, cupcake, jalebi, and gulab jamun.\nAbout the soup, I have had better hot n sour soup but it was a good start to the meal and I'm glad it had just the right amount of spice (didn't add anything to it). I don't recommend having too much because there's a lot of variety so you will feel full quicker and probably wont be able to try everything.\nThe Kachori and aloo were spot on. I'm no desi food expert but i've had plenty and these were pretty good, although I just wish the Kachori was a little warmer. \nThe pasta was quite nice, had a tomato based sauce and was garmished with cheese and herbs. YUM.\nThe rice and manchurian as you can see, I mixed (very typical of me I agree HAHA). It was pretty good. The chicken was well cooked and the gravy thankfully didn't taste like ketchup saalan.\nI don't generally like fish but the shaadion wali fried fish is always to die for (nothing healthy here hahaha). This fish too, was delectable and fresh. It wasn't over-coated or over greasy (ya know, wasn't a little tukra of machli inside a large cocoon of flour). I quite liked it on it's own, didn't want to dip into sauce (I hope the sauce I very nicely ignored was tartar and not just mayonnaise).\nThe shawarma type roll-thingy wasn't like authentic shawarma but rather had a mayonnaise type taste. It didn't taste bad at all, i'd just rather call it a pita roll rather than a shawarma lol.\nAt this point I was full to the brim but had to try the desserts so let me just say this cupcake was no ordinary sookha hua anday ki smell wala cupcake, it was actually pretty good. I went back for another (guilty as charged).\nPakistani restaurants are always killin it with the piping hot gulaab jamuns so need I say more???? 10/10\nAs you can tell I couldn't stop laughing because everyone was being served hot, crispy jalebis on their tables amidst their meals but truth be told, they tasted good (couldn't have more than one bite warna waheen heart attack hojata).\nI really liked how the manager went twice/ thrice to each table to ask if everything was fine and there were no issues. They were serving unlimited refills of peach juice which is quite nice.\n\nThe Hi Tea buffet costs 799 plus tax per person which adds up to around 900 pkr. Is it worth it? Yes! And sit next to the windows to have your meal with a view. And have little amounts of everything so you can try everything. And don't have lunch before you go!""",b'Zenia Binte Qaiser Khan',"b""Photos from Zenia Binte Qaiser Khan's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1628735823813882&set=gm.1681086575275819&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1681086575275819/',2017-10-07 05:09:49,129,59,3,119,8,2,0,0,0

They had a generous amount of chicken and cheese, and remained crispy till the end. If you're looking for the best nachos, Ranoush is the place to be. \n\nMozzarella Cheese Balls were served next. We like ours cheesier so we conveyed the message to the chef himself as well as the co-owner Mr Ansar who was hearing our feedback with all ears. \n\nFor main courses, we had their Entrecote Steak, Moroccan Chicken, Cashew Nut Chicken, Spaghetti Shrimps Pasta and Crispy Stuffed Burger. Of these Spaghetti Shrimps Pasta and Crispy Stuffed Burger stole the show. \n\nThe Spaghetti Shrimp Pasta was absolutely divine. It was a bit spicy for us but we loved it. The shrimps were well-cooked and the dish was thoroughly enjoyable and bursting with flavours.\n\nCrispy Stuffed Burger was one of the best we have had here in Karachi. The beef was juicy and well-marinated with a generous amount of cheese. Not too much. Not too little. The buns, too, were baked in house and we were glad they could hold all the meat and cheese without crumbling down which is what happens at most burger places.\n\nFollowed by the main courses came the desserts and they looked just beautiful! They were so tempting that we did not feel like spoiling the fantastic presentation. As expected, the temptation got the better of us and we devoured them to the last bite.\n\nFrosted brownie and cookie were served with vanilla ice cream. They were such a perfect combination of hot and cold dessert. We particularly loved the hot chocolate oozing out from the cookie.\n\nTaste: 7/10\nQuality: 7.5/10\nQuantity: 8/10\nPrice: 7/10\nMenu Selection: 8/10\n\nLocation: 4/5\nAmbiance: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nPresentation: 5/5\nHygiene: 4/5""",b'Tehniat Ali',"b""Photos from Tehniat Ali's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156170214476350&set=gm.1828953720489103&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1828953720489103/',2018-02-26 11:00:48,32,1,0,27,4,1,0,0,0

165861103465048_1828682400516235,"b""#TSGBLOGGERNIDAABBAS\nEatery: Shisi- Pan Asian Bistro\n\n I am sure you must have heard the name. It's a causal dine in for authentic Chinese,Thai and Japanese cuisine.  This restaurant is located in the heart of Karachi at Sindhi Muslim. The interior of this restaurant is extremely beautiful!! Clearly shows how much they've had worked on this restaurant's set up. They even provide valet parking which is a blessing considering it's location.\n\nLet's start with the starters. We were served the following items:\nSpicy Coconut Soup\nKimchi  Dip\nDynamite Prawns\nThread Chicken\n\nSpicy Coconut Soup:\nThe soup consisted of intense and aromatic flavours with rich and creamy coconut infused broth. It's not just a treat to the taste buds but in fact visually beautiful too. A perfect balanced of texture and taste!!\n\nKimchi Dip:\nKimchi used to be one of the best things they had available at all good restaurants in Hong Kong. It's a staple in Korean cuisine. The kimchi they had here had the correct spice, tanginess and a bit of sweet was a complete seller!! \n\nDynamite Prawns:\nPerfectly battered fried prawns tossed with honey mayo chilli glaze, the prawns they are serving are literally one of its kind!! I was lost for words when I took the first bite!! This appetizer literally UP-ed the game! A friend said they tasted similar to the ones she had at P.F Chang's. \n\nThread Chicken:\nThis appetizer was new for me, I am sure many of the people know about this already since it's very common in ramzan. Thread Chicken was very tender from the inside and crunchy on the outside!! The flavour of the chicken sort of reminded me of kfc's chicken BUT 'A LOT BETTER VERSION.'\n\nWe were served the following entrees:\nSriracha Chicken\nCrispy Beef\nMongolian Chicken \nVegetable Fried Rice \n Egg Fried Rice \nGarlic Fried Rice \nNutella Cake \n\nSriracha Chicken:\nSriracha Chicken is basically a mixture of sweet & spicy flavors. If you are like me and crave for some good spicy food then you should go to shisi today and try this out!! \n\nCrispy Beef:\nThis was the star of the evening! Right amount of crisp with extremely juicy flavourful beef inside! It was one dish I couldn't stop myself from eating.\n\nMongolian Chicken:\nModerately spiced, crispy, sweet chicken coated with this addictive sweet/salty sauce which was extremely delicious with some vegetable rice. Was this my favourite on the menu? No. Would I still eat it? YES! \n\nComing To The Rice:\nWhen you order a bowl of rice here you just have to pay for one serving and the refills are free of cost. You can eat as much as rice you would like. How cool is that? I love how the egg and vegetable rice had freshness to it, whereas garlic rice was the only thing I wouldn't swear by. My friend surely enjoyed her share of garlic rice but when it comes to me I would prefer vegetable rice over it. \n\nNutella Cake:\nAnything that has Nutella can never ever go wrong. Am I right? We were served a slice of their famous Nutella cake and I kid you not, one single bite took me right into food coma. The picture does not do justice to how delicious it was!\n\nVerdict:\nOver all experience was amazing and I would really recommend everyone to give this place a try it's like we have this amazing place so nearby and we've missed out on it!\n\nRating: \nTaste: (8/10)\nQuantity: (8/10)\nPresentation: (7.5/10)\nService: (7.5/10)""",b'Nida Abbas',"b""Photos from Nida Abbas's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155036374742610&set=gm.1828682400516235&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1828682400516235/',2018-02-26 05:17:15,71,20,3,66,4,1,0,0,0

I have never had Panini at Sizzlerz but if you guys have eaten it you know this is clearly NOT a Panini. We told him so and asked him to please check they kept claiming it was and that that's how the chef made it. \n\nAfter repeatedly politely explaining the guy that this is not a Panini and showing that the sandwich had mushrooms and other veggies that weren't listed in what we ordered he agreed to have it switched with something else. \n\nFor those who have eaten Panini at Sizzlerz is this really what you get?

165861103465048_1826647117386430,"b""#TSGBloggerSMH\nNot a review but a message\n\nSo the free burger posts of foodpanda are popping up today and all of them say that a PSLUBL20 code has been used. Well foodpanda just highlighted that this was a glitch on their system due to which a 20% discount was being calculated as a 100% discount.\nWe feel sorry for foodpanda as one can't imagine the amount of loss they wouldve faced due to this and for the general public we would just like to highlight a couple of things:\n\n1- No eatery or service offers a 100% discount on just one item order and it is highly unlikely that you will pay Rs.90 or 200 only for 6-7 burgers each of which are worth around 500-600 each. So in such cases its actually a better option if you can verify from the eatery about the discount as we know one can have the guilt of other having a loss.\n \n2- This is targetted towards the people who comment and often use harsh words unknowingly. When someone posts about such things please avoid using harsh words against them as they didn't know about the issue and even if they did you're no one to judge. We've a very rude mindset amongst our nation in which we act as judge jury and executioner. Even I was targeted today by one such gentleman who called me a robber not because I had availed the discount but because I had highlighted and clarified the issue.\n\nPoint being, don't use harsh words just like  that. There's always a polite way to get your point across. Also stop judging people over petty things.""",b'Syed Muneeb Hussaini',,photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213820536580302&set=gm.1826647117386430&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1826647117386430/',2018-02-24 08:36:50,91,26,1,64,3,0,24,0,0

A large, bright yellow logo with an attractive bold font that catches the eye instantly. \n\nA group of 3 food mongers ordered what seemed to be the best on their menu: Smoked BBQ Beef and Bacon Burger, The Bistrovia Beef Burger (both burgers served with an extra patty), and Chicken Alfredo Pasta. \n\nOverall ratings: \n\nTaste: 8/10\n\nQuality: 8/10\n\nQuantity: 8.5/10\n\nAmbiance: 7/10\n\nLocation: 7/10\n\nHygiene: 8.5/10\n\nValue for Money: 9/10\n\nCost: Roughly PKR 550/- per head (including extra patty and a drink!)\n\nStarting off with the burgers \xe2\x80\x93 Smoked BBQ Beef and Bacon Burger: PLEASE BEFORE YOU JUMP YOUR SEATS, Bacon is not pork it is simply a specific type of meat cut prepared on a grill. No one in Pakistan serves Pork Bacon. This was halal, cow meat. Anyway, as you can probably see from the pictures, the double patty burger is monstrosity at its best. 120-gram double patties, topped with cheddar cheese, iceberg, bacon and a very flavorful Smoked BBQ sauce. The burger was pure beauty. The patty was fresh, it wasn't breaking, it was firm, cooked rightfully on the grill and juicy most importantly. The bun was also not soggy and seemed as if baked right this morning. A good burger always satisfies my hungry tummy, and this one was a winner. \n\nI had the chance to also taste the Bistrovia Beef burger \xe2\x80\x93 it was a classic beef burger topped with a ripe piece of tomato and some of their own made sauces. Giant, and juicy. Served with an electric lemonade on the side gives you a refreshing boost with every sip. \n\nThe chicken penne pasta with alfredo sauce was served beautifully. The chicken was grilled and season to perfection. It was tender, juicy and not chewy at all. The sauce was thick, filled with flavor although for me, a little too much parmesan on the top that kind of gets in your way. But overall, nice dish. \n\nAll in all, a great place for a family lunch or dinner. Sweet and kind waiters, delivering you food within 15-20 minutes of serving time. \n\nFor more food fun visit: instagram.com/hamzasfoodventures""",b'Hamza Salman Siddiqui',"b""Photos from Hamza Salman Siddiqui's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155775554135269&set=gm.1791155350935607&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1791155350935607/',2018-01-21 09:33:29,241,66,9,228,12,1,0,0,0

First they served complimentary yakhni, then main course then we ordered tasty kunafa and then they served complimentary Qahwa with lemon and sugar.\n\nOn this visit, it was Sunday, the restaurant was busy, but still not full and there was no waiting. But still their service and food quality both declined drastically. At first, there was no yakhni, when I asked the waiter he told me that today there was a complaint in it so they were not serving it. Ok fine. But then he told me that the food will take 40 minutes as they have run out of the ready to serve madfoon. I said ok we'll wait. Then he served us the food in 20 minutes, 1 mutton madfoon was cold and dry, even the foil wrap was open. The second serving of mutton madfoon was steamy hot, full of juice, and tightly wrapped in the foil. To that, I can only make one conclusion that 1 madfoon was served straight from the kitchen and the cold one must be a returned order of some other customer(because it's foil was also open). I cant understand why they did that? They really think the customer won't feel the difference? Either they think that the customer is a fool or they don't really care about their reputation and brand image. Anyways, when I complained about it, the manager told the waiter to change that cold madfoon. After 15 minutes, he came back to tell us that it'll take allot of time to prepare fresh so we should order something else in it's place. Utterly disappointing service, if they had some problem in that why they waited 15 minutes before informing us? Anyways I told him to cancel it.\nThen after the dinner, kunafa was delicious, but not as hot as it should have been. After that, he brought the bill, without asking me... Like he's wanting us to leave. Then I asked him what happened to the Qahwa... To which he replied oh it's just coming. It means he was trying to skip it too... Qahwa was served with high quantity of sugar mixed, it was sweeter than Kunafa and there was no lemon...\n\nThat was the difference in a Thursday and a Sunday, despite the fact the restaurant was still not FULL... They couldn't manage and maintain their service and food quality.\n\nThat was my last visit.""",b'Hassaan Ahmad Hashmi',"b""Photos from Hassaan Ahmad Hashmi's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155962750015874&set=gm.1828147910569684&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1828147910569684/',2018-02-25 18:00:44,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It means these garlic bread pieces are 40% off? Its totally a cheap gimmick! Where is 40% off ? To my curiosity I called Broadway to ask whats the science behind this so the representative told me Sir if you buy all these things separately jo amount bnega uska 40% off hy is deal main. I asked but you already have a deal in menu of 999rs. He said Sir wo hamara menu hy woh foodpanda ka. I am still not satisfied its cheap marketing simply? Isn't it guys?

Oh yes I must say the quantity of that mutton was very generous! Meat was just spot on as I picked up the meat and oh man how satisfying it was to watch that perfectly slow cooked meat sliding down so beautifully off that bone\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d\xf0\x9f\x98\x8b\nMutton was really good quality wise and also in taste didn\'t like the fresh ground pepper they sprinkled on the meat as original Mandi is not served that way. Maybe it\'s their variation or something.\n\xf0\x9f\x8d\x96\nThe rice were cooked well and quantity was less than the meat however we got them refilled later. Everything was good but that extra use of garam masala was over powering everything the rice also had the same issue that I felt was ruining the originality of the actual dish, however it lacked saffron flavor as well. \xf0\x9f\x8d\x9a\nOverall it was very good but just that too much use of garam masala ruined the original taste of Mandi, maybe some people like it but still it\'s a suggestion to cut down on the garam masala! \xf0\x9f\x8d\x96\nTalking about the desserts first comes the ""KUNAFA KING"" double layer of vermicelli stuffed with cream cheese hardly could taste any topped with cream, it was dry there was no rosewater and sugar syrup taste in it the kunafa. Vermicelli were dry and burnt from the corners. They\'re doing a variation or a Desi way of kunafa I should say it\'s nowhere near the original kunafa. \xf0\x9f\x8d\xae\nCream caramel was a mild sweet dessert tasted like a pudding. Was a light dessert. Liked it much.\nAlso in the end they served us lil baby Pan\'s as mouth fresheners which were too cute to eat\xf0\x9f\x92\x96\n\xf0\x9f\x8d\x96\nA good experience just they should cut down on garam masala hopefully they\'ll achieve the original taste of Mandi.\nFor more food stories visit \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thebitteneat.khi/\n\xf0\x9f\x8d\x9a'",b'Tehreem Fawad',"b""Photos from Tehreem Fawad's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1800222840048260&set=gm.1826774050707070&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1826774050707070/',2018-02-24 10:52:35,7,3,0,7,0,0,0,0,0

165861103465048_1823570264360782,"b""#TSGBloggerSMH\nMoos 'n' Clucks - A casual getaway\nIf you're looking for an affordable quick fix for those burger and cheesy cravings then you ought to hit this eatery. \n\n#SMHpoints: 7.5/10\n\nWhen you're with friends, seldom you opt for options that are on the fine dining side or high end side. You're in need of a quick bite at the most affordable price without damaging your taste buds. This place caters to such getaways and provides you with that casual environment to be comfortable in.\n\n So a couple of days back we visited this place and ordered a couple of things and here's a review of them:\n\n#ChickenCheesePoppers: 4 Crispy chicken strips filled with creamy cheese sauce and topped with honey mustard, these beauties are a killer. On top of that considering the price, you just need to try them out! On every bite you can feel the tender chicken and the sauces blending together to give you that tantalizing sensation. \nPrice: 220\nPoints: 4/5\n\n#BeastFries & #CottageFries: They don't joke when they say beast. These beast fries was topped generously with minced beef, cheese and sauces. The fries were crispy, well cooked and felt amazing. The cottage fries were no far behind, blended with the cheese and served with two chicken strips filled with creamy cheese and topped with honey mustard, they're a showstopper if you're a cheese lover.\nPrice: 160 each\nPoints: 4/5\n\n#Jalape\xc3\xb1oRoyaleBeef: Well this one didn't really appeal to my taste buds. The sauce felt a bit off with this one and was a bit too spicy and left a bad tinge. The patty however was tender and well cooked. \nPrice: 260\nPoints: 2/5\n\n#PortlandWinnerBeef: This is your signature beef patty burger loaded with cheese topping and creamy sauces. It feels good when you take a bite of this providing satisfaction to those cheesy creamy feeling with the tender beef blending in.\nPrice: 260\nPoints: 3/5\n\n#GoeyBlue: A must try and a definite winner. A chicken patty filled with cheese, topped with honey mustard and delicately placed between two soft bun slices. This was a burger that was surely made with love.\nPrice: 280\nPoints: 4/5\n\n#MacNcheeseBunlessBurger: Well this was a mixed review with out group. Being a Mac and Cheese lover, I was mesmerized by every bite of this beauty whereas the rest of us were not that impressed. As the delicately fried macaroni patties combined with a chicken patty and a mother load of cheese and honey mustard, this burger was a come back soon sign for me.\nPrice: 340\nPoints: 3.5/5\n\n#Ambiance: Well its a pretty small place and you can feel a bit crammed if you're in a big group. It also doesn't have any restrooms which is not at all, 'okay'. They need to accommodate a restroom there.\nPoints: 2.5/5\n\n#Service: Well the service is really good. The staff and management are both very courteous and the order time is also pretty efficient. Really satisfied with it.\nPoints: 4/5\n\nOverall:\n#Food: 8/10\n#Service: 8/10\n#Ambiance: 7.5/10\n#Value for money: 8.5/10\n#Quality: 8/10\n\n#Total: 40/50\n\nFor more highlights follow:\nfb.com/urbanredefined\nurbanredefinedpk.com\nInstagram.com/urban_redefined\n\nhttp://www.urbanredefinedpk.com/2018/02/22/restaurant-review-moos-n-clucks/""",b'Syed Muneeb Hussaini',"b""Photos from Syed Muneeb Hussaini's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213796448898125&set=gm.1823570264360782&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1823570264360782/',2018-02-21 12:39:24,148,37,0,137,7,4,0,0,0

Trust me u cant get better steak at this price tag from anywhere else.\nChicken Manchurian: i ordered half Chickn Manchurian and it satisfied my remaining hunger. Portion of chicken was overloaded and tatsed different (in good manner) from others.\nRoasted beef sandwich: it was recommended by owner and it was next level sandwich.\nPolo regular pizza: we couldn\'t get our hands on pizza as thr oven was malfunctioning and they were not able to serve which they were apologetic about.\nOnly problem i faced thr was no TV.

165861103465048_1826538580730617,"b""DESI GUY!\n\nReview for Mandi House \n\nIt was my birthday, so my family decided to go to Mandi House after hearing so much good things about this restaurant. Places was extremely crowded with customers as it was Sunday, but they were catering everyone with proper numbering system and everything controlled by computers.\n\nRestaurant is on the service lane of Tariq road churangi, which is not much popular but this restarant is I think standing alone at that lane. Ambiance of the is also mesmerizing, they have two options for dining, on table dine in or sitting on the floor with separate compartment. Basement area is all filled with floor sitting and ground is with table sitting area. \n\nWaiters and managers are well trained, their speaking skills etc was up to proper restaurant's standards. The most I like at this restaurant was cleanliness, staff was well trained to clean dirty area again and again, once the table or floor sitting is empty by customer they just get 1 or 2 minutes to get it clean and they do it perfectly.\n\nLets come up to the food or else people well say its paid post haha, well its not I went their about 4 times and they made me satisfied each time.\n\nOrder;\n\n1- Mutton Yakhni \n\nWell it was complimentary with the food, on this visit yakhni was not up to the mark. Waiter said this is residue from the dish, if you don't like we will change that but at that moment we realize this is tasteless our food came and we left the yakhni.\nMy visits before this last visit, their yakhni was ok with proper mutton's taste in it will little sourness of lemon.       \nrate 6/10 (Giving general rating, not based on my last visit)\n\n2- Mutton Madfoon - (ordered for 2 persons pkr 2400/-)\n\nNicely marinated mutton cooked in buried style. Black pepper was over powering the whole marination and giving the acute taste of spices and mutton is self. Meat was awesomely tendered that bones can easily be separated.\nrate 8/10\n\n3- Mutton Haneeth - (ordered for 4 persons pkr 4600/-)\n\nThis dish was a bit unique for me, it was marinated with white spices specially white pepper and salt, cooker in baked style (tandoor). I personally like this as the meat was tendered pink in color and spices was balanced with salt to taste good in mouth. \nrate 9/10\n\nBoth the dishes served with rice and vegetables. Rice was properly cooked and was complimentary in quantity. Tomato sauce and raita was also served with both the dishes and they were also good to taste.\n\n4- Kunafa - (ordered two for pkr 900/-)\n\nHave tried kunafa in Turkey, Uae and Saudia, dish originated from Gaziantep and I always wanted to visit that place. \n\nWell having much idea about kunafa from all over the world, I must say this is the best Kunafa in Karachi I have ever eaten. The combination of cheesiness, sweetness and crunchiness is very soothing for mouth.\nrate 9.5/10\n\nHighly recommended place to go except sundays (rush factor).\nRating : 8/10\n\nSorry for not having the proper pictures as we were two hungry, I realized afterwards that I have to post it in Swot then I took pictures. \nThanks Mandi House official for greeting so nicely for my Birthday.""",b'Saad Qamar Bhatti',"b""Photos from Saad Qamar Bhatti's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155373780961033&set=gm.1826538580730617&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1826538580730617/',2018-02-24 07:12:09,8,0,0,7,1,0,0,0,0

My temperature was medium well as usual, and their steak happened to be among the best steak in Karachi. \nTenderloin's size was good and it was very juicy & tender, middle part was the perfect pink according to the steak standards. If we talk about presentation, it was brilliantly played with the potatoes, vegetables, mushrooms and sauces. Their were two sauces in the plate, one was quite peppery and other was creamy, both the sauces was amazing in taste with the meat.\n9/10\n\n2- Jalapeno Pizza \n\nThis was the perfect plat bread pizza with ample topping on it wit chicken and veges. I have tried pizzas in Italy, can say this was the similar version to that pizza. \nOverall taste was good, just suggestion from my side to try to make it round in size.\n8/10\n\nMy visit to this restaurant wasn't planned, as I was going to other restaurant that was closed and then I came to MTC.\nMy overall experience to MTC was really good and I do recommend this restaurant in my social circle also...\nOverall ratings 9/10\n\nNote: Team of Meat the Cheese please find the way for eliminating the nasty smell when heated raclette come on the floor.\n\nTotal Damage: 2,588, including drinks and 13 % tax.""",b'Saad Qamar Bhatti',"b""Photos from Saad Qamar Bhatti's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155366291261033&set=gm.1823334424384366&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1823334424384366/',2018-02-21 08:26:16,62,27,2,57,1,4,0,0,0

I have had Nachos at many places and this was nothing like Nachos at all. I had to took them back after a couple of picks. The Crispy Chicken Wrap was not at all Crispy and you can call it Messy Chicken Wrap because the Tortilla was burnt and you could taste the burn throughout and the Tortilla was all messed up with the sauce and I couldn't hold it at all. Everytime I took a bite messed up my face which was embarassing. The Cheesy Chicken Tortillas consisted of burnt Tortillas as well and it didn't taste good at all due to the burn.

However in the case of Golden Bite Pizza I'll have to say i'm blown away. Golden Bite Pizza interior looks like a typical restaurant inside a small shop. Their Kitchen was open so we can see the cleaness. but Overall i was not impressed with the decor and ambiance. The food is what i'm most impressed with (after all I was not there to smell the roses)\n\nWe Order 3 Different flavours of Pizza. \n1) GoldenBite Special\n2) Kabab Chaska \n3) Fajita Sensation \n\nThe Kabab chaska was simply amazing. I'd chose this flavour on any other flavour in Karachi, It was really outstanding.  \nFajita Sensation was Average. It was not that Spicy as i thought before ordering. ( I like a bit Spicy though).\nAnd last but not least Golden Bite Special. It was also really good, morelike Chicken Supreme Pizza but with a little touch of Creamy Tikka Pizza.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nAmbiance 6/10\nFood 8.5/10\nservice 9/10 (it was quick)\nValue of money 8/10\n\nI'd definately like to visit there again with my office buds. & hope to enjoy variaty of pizza once again.""",b'Faraz Ahmad',"b""Photos from Faraz Ahmad's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=290233948173375&set=gm.1824446490939826&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1824446490939826/',2018-02-22 10:25:25,27,7,0,25,1,1,0,0,0

A friend and I made our journey down this gem of a restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised, but there were a few significant differences.\n\nThe menu rarely collapses into purple prose apart from the occasional ""palate-awakening"" and the ""Show Time"" section of dishes but #ChupaRustom does offer dishes I\'ve never heard of before. Take ""Machroon key Sughaat"" as an example. A beautiful balance of sweetness and acidity in a traditional tomato rasam, poured over a seafood festival with tomato bread on the side. \n\nThe first, Garlic Tikkah an amalgam of boneless chicken perfumed with the heady flavor of garlic tikkah spices, was punctuated with roasted garlic and paneer. Darjan Darjan Kebab, fantastic juicy seekh kebabs bursting with flavors of fresh onions, herbs and green chillies\n\nA mexican selections with two splendid flavors arrived with a mountain of greens. Desi Tacos. Soft makai ki Roti, sarson ka saag, Paneer and Desi salsa on one side and braised chicken tikkah lacha on the other. This was very recommended, however it didn\'t really come up to the mark. \n\nPrawn curry is a creamy, velvety dish with delicious depth of flavour. Less unusual, though no less authentic, was the rich, filling curry leaves, with its slowly simmered chunks of prawns in a vibrantly seasoned rai and tomato sauce.\n\nLastly for dessert, we ordered both that were on the menu. Doodh doubleroti which is apparently inhouse pound cake, seared and soaked in almond milk, topped with crispy jalebi and clotted cream (I searched and searched and searched but did not find my jalebi). Shahi turkre. Freshly baked bread stuffed with khoya. Golden, deep fried and topped off with sweet milk, almond and pistachios (nope.) \n\nWe were also served with strawberries dipped in dark chocolate complimentary. Strawberries were incredibly fresh. \n\nAlthough Chupa Rustom\'s menu narrowly focuses on desi specialties, its not a desi restaurant. However, their quality, presentation and service is unbeatable. \n\nWITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SHADOW OF DOUBT THEIR KEBABS REMAINS THE BEST. \n\n(Things that took incredibly long: wheat naan + our remaining cash from the bill.)'",b'Aisha S.

Just got back home and boy let me roll up my sleeves for this huge rant I never usually write.\nTalk about getting a Grand Birthday being reserved at this fairly new \'Supposed\' edgy \' Spanish \'eatery in Karachi being Utterly spoiled and ruined by None other than the Loco staff and the ALMOST- CHOKING- TO-DEATH ( WITHOUT A HAZARD AHEAD FOOD WARNING SIGN) Food.\nHave money to waste?No?Good, Because every penny you\'ve earned is precious. Oh So you have money to waste? Head out to Loco ;) \nLet\'s talk about the food shall we? \nOn a table of 12, Just 3 Menu cards were distributed which had to be awkwardly rolled and shared out because Apparently they were short on them. How embarrassing!\nOkay - The FOOD and The person taking our order. \nBeing a tiny cosy place, with music too loud for the person to even take out orders it was a Mayhem. With only 2 servers actually serving the entire Lot at Loco, I feel sorry! For you and the customers.\nFOOD - Here we come. \nUpon arriving we were instantly told \'WE ARE NOT SERVING PIZZA\'s and ANY GRILLED CHICKEN\'. Woah! That was a major shocker! On such a limited menu you have the nerve to slap our appetites, knowing we\'ve reserved prior to the day AND ITS A BIRTHDAY DINNER, NOT A BLOODY WALK-IN CASUAL DINNER FOR 2.\nOkay, so 6 of us who wanted Pollo Al Carbon(Grilled Chicken) and Pizza went like Fine, what other good option do you have. To this they were least bothered to tell us any other good option so we went for Ajillo Chicken dish. Talk about Chicken swimming in a broth of Bitter chilli oil enough to choke you to death by the first inhale. Oh, USA might invade the single  serving thinking the oil is a Jackpot from the Middleeast! With three tiny rubber breads, it was sheer Punishment. The other Beef entree was another nail in the coffin. Too chewy, too bitter to swallow. AND A FEW WERE NOT EVEN SERVED TILL WE ALMOST BEGGED THEM THAT WE\'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE PLEASE SERVE. HOW BLOODY EMBARASSING! And adding the feather to their caps UPON GETTING ALL OUR ORDERS ON OUR TABLES - MR. MANOJ, THE SUPPOSED PERSON TO TAKE OUR ORDER AND LATER TELLING US THAT HE\'S THE CO-Manager TELLS US THAT ""Oh Hey, Fellas, now that you\'ve ordered, this shitload of nonsensical food, we just have the \'NO PIZZA AS MENTIONED EARLIER\' Reversed. ITS BACK ON THE MENU, YOU FOOLS \xf0\x9f\x98\x81 \nLong story short, after Dodging the bullets, Almost choking on the food, Horrible service, EXTREMELY LATE FOOD Being served, a few of the LOCO team people couldn\'t face the storm and despite asking for MR RAYYAN DURRANI ( Who wasn\'t in the house at that time) the  other co founder/manager Mr Raza couldn\'t make eye contact with us and showed Zero courtesy behind their glass window like a spectator while Mr.Manoj tried to cheat his eye contact with us and was on a Repeat with \'We\'re sorry but Eff you guys, that\'s all folks, Shows over you may leave\' THATS HOW HORRIBLE LOCO WAS TODAY. I would like them to be apologetic not by words but with action as well! Mr Rayyan, I\'d like you to get to me and at least know how your DREAM PROJECT just LOST 12 and more people from your prospective future diners. Loco is a Spanish Inspirarion, you walk in and see this amazing painting of Frida Kahlo. TODAY I RELATED TO ONE OF HER FAMOUS SAYINGS ""AT THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN ENDURE MUCH MORE THAN WE CAN"".

I availed it at Tariq Road branch without difficulties and got my three naanwhiches for 520 rs . One is for 260 rs. The taste was good and it was difficult to eat it with ettiquettes...\n\nNow COOLfies whose screenshot I have in mobile , but my fingers are typing from a laptop keyboard hence I cant show the evidence that I was one of the winners of Kashmir Day contest with few other people. The message I got clearly said it was again buy one and get one free and I could avail it as many times til 28th February. I showed the message to the guy at the stall of COOLfies and he was scared like I am asking to give all kulfi\'s for free.\n"" Yeh offer 18 feb tak thi abhi ka humko nai pata"" . I said to text the person infront of me , he did "" type"" a few words on his mobile, but since I was standing I did want to try it. Hence I ordered one Crunchy Crunch regular for 160 rs. I repeated my voucher multiple times but he was not bothered nor the response ever came on his mobile. The kulfi was just fine and vermicelli was old for sure since it was rubbery as if the guy just wanted to get rid off it. COOLfies if you cant afford to give through competitions why do you even announce such things? \nThis was a very good lesson for me that never go for so called buy one get one free, its better to eat on your money only instead of expecting you to stay on your words. When the message clearly stated its 28th February you changed the date to  18th February and if you did so could have atleast informed me . Never going to have kulfies from you nor I want anything complimentary .

I always give one chance to new outlets to impress me or It would be my first and the last visit . we went there at around 7 o\'clock and luckily the queue was not too long or not too short (jo thi  uska  koi  saar  paow  nai tha) . the first thing that came into my mind when i tried to order was bhai yeh sirf fries hai tu Itni zillat  Kyun because there was no system sab log chips wale Chacha kay moo main ghus Huye thy so as a pound Pakistani I did the same. As the first batch of fries  came which made around 20 boxes the Chacha took money from the 20 people standing there and then we had to wait for 5 minutes because the fries had to go into the microwave so the cheese could melt. After 30 min or so I got my order and for those 30 min I was just thinking wtf  am I doing Itni Kuwari for fries. Finally my order was ready and i took it to my car and opened the box. YES the taste was superb and it made me forget all the misery. The price of one box is 160rs which is very economical for the quantity and the quality being served\nSo I give it a 9/10 for the taste \nP.s the flavours made my day although the experience of waiting there was not good khair akhir me Sabar ka phal bara cheesy hota hai :D'",b'Muhammad Ahmed',"b""Photos from Muhammad Ahmed's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155293065036818&set=gm.1779937815390694&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1779937815390694/',2018-01-10 06:31:18,107,33,2,97,2,0,8,0,0

Flying saucer, dum qeema, masala bites, shawarma and guess what? Nothing was available except parathas and bunkababs. \n\nKhair, because we were starving at that point and primarily ventured out for bunkababs, that's what we ordered, along with anda paratha (Not pictured), aalu paratha (Pictured), and lachaydaar paratha (Not pictured). \n\nThankfully whatever we ordered more than made up for the non-availability of other items we wanted to try. The Special anda daal bunkabab was almost as good as my childhood favorite, Super Nursery Bunkabab. The lachayddar paratha was truly lachaydaar, buttery and crispy, delightful bites of goodness. The anda paratha was reminiscent of old-school dhaaba style paratha, where the omelet is sandwiched on top of the paratha, making it a greasily delightful mouthful. Don't try to soak up the excess oil with a tissue. Just don't. Enjoy the greasy goodness. The aalu paratha was a spicy surprise, with a generous potato filling within the crispy confines of the paratha itself. 3 cups of doodh patti minus ilaichi were ordered and enjoyed as well. \n\nDesi Gali is definitely worth a visit, as long as you're willing to compromise on not having half the menu available.\n\nP.S: There is an adorable stray cat at Desi Gali, marmalade coat. If you see him, please be nice to him. He seems mostly tame and is willing to eat anything thrown his way. He's a playful, innocent creature.

""UFFF ITNI OBVIOUS BAD BOU THI US MAI, TRY AGAIN KA SUN K BHOOSA MAARNE KA DIL KARA""\nAnyways we asked them to take it away. They then forced us that they\'ll bring another one which doesn\'t stink.. Well after waiting for half an hour, we told them to cancel the order and bring the bill since it\'s taking way too long. ""AISI FISH SERVE HNE K BAD COURTESY MAI WAIT KIYA, GALAY PAR GAYA"" Meanwhile the manager came and said to us that the fish type is changed for some time... (though I had had this one a week ago from another branch and it didn\'t stink...) So I told him that okay I don\'t want to try this ""new type"" of fish but he said it\'s cooked now and you\'ll like it this time. ""TMHE KIS NE KAHA BHAI K I\'LL LIKE IT?""\nWaited another 5 minutes after that stupid conversation and then was again served with the same stinky fish which we returned to them. I asked them to bring the bill which by the way was brought after 20 minutes. Well in the end they didn\'t charge us for it. I was asked to fill the feedback form as well on which I mentioned that the service was very poor since they were very slow. Well it doesn\'t end here.. The waiter came to me and said ""Ma\'am ap ne service ko poor kaha. Service tou poor ni thi. Ap isko sahi kr dai form pe please"" \nMtlb zabardasti fish khilao bad bou daar phr zabardasti feedback form fill krao apni marzi ka.

Little did we know that we were in for disappointment equal to 3 times as we went through each flavor. A very ordinary launch by McDonalds. The fries were not the classic skinny ones but quite thick and soggy, sauces were nothing special but they were anything but loaded. They were supplemented by a strange Chaat Masala like Lemon Chilli Masala which they have imported from India. Nothing Special. Each flavor was north of RS. 200. \n\n1- BBQ Fries - We will let the pic help you judge for yourself.\n\n2- Nacho Cheese Fries - The sauce was decent in this one or maybe just because it was Cheese but quite ordinary over all. Maybe adding Jalape\xc3\xb1os would have helped but we didn't add them on. \n\n3- Mayo Garlic Fries - So many eateries have perfected the art of Garlic Mayo in Karachi, even some Roll Points have better Garlic Mayo products.\n\nPakistan in general is a very small community for food eateries where things go viral and trends are very short lived but very helpful for brands that can capitalize. McDonalds fails despite being a truly global brand. Will I not stop for a McOreo late at night because of this mishap no, but as soon as I have a better local option for the flurry, Ill run.

After wondering for half a minute where the guy vanished, I parked the car myself only to be asked by him to move the car as it was in place of their service van. He took the keys to do himself. Not a great start.\nInterior was pleasant and comfortable. We were served complimentary garlic bread which was good. After placing our order for steaks, I informed of bogo voucher which the waiter refused flatly. Upon insistence, he took it to manager and after sometime confirmed that it will be accepted. Steaks were ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. The dessert section was not completely available and waiter excused due to it being a new establishment. We ordered gelato and the ice creams were good. Presentation was great but the quantity left a lot to be desired.\nI focus primarily on food taste and there was nothing in steaks to return. Also, the menu was very vague to guide on steak selection.

165861103465048_1588636057854205,"b'#TSGBLOGGERHAMZA  \n\nEatery: The Deli\n\nThis post contains TWO of Deli\'s highlights: one is their catering service and the \nsecond is their high tea.\n\nSo, The Deli has a reputation for being a fine, semi-formal, kind of dining place ever since it opened. The setting, the d\xc3\xa9cor, the fancy menu items and much more. So far, it has lived up o its reputation when it comes to their ala carte menu. I found very few people who have complained about horrible experiences there, true nothing is ever perfect but the deli has hit their high notes well. \n\nThe first few pictures that depict food being setup on a separate table shows how they provide customization catering services for parties, whether at the deli or anywhere else you\'d wish. They estimate that this beautifully setup with a buffet costs around PKR 2000 per head, and go more depending on how you want to customize it to your needs. For more information, you can get in touch with The Deli management themselves. This is something we did not taste. But what we did try was their high tea. \n\nThis is what their menu was for a regular high tea: \n\nVietnamese rice wrapper rolls\nThe deli classic taco (replaced with mango salsa and tortilla)\nTartine with cherry tomato and basil\nTartine with seared beef and horseradish \nClassic chicken Ceaser\'s wrap \nWood fire oven pizzetta \nButtermilk scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream \nChocolate plum tart \nMango Eton mess \nTea/coffee\n\nThe timings for high tea are from 4pm to 6pm daily and their introductory prices are 750 + tax per head. For those looking for ratings, find them right below \xe2\x80\x93 others looking for a detailed review please read further: \n\nTaste: 7.5/10\nPresentation: 8.5/10\nVariety: 8/10\nQuality and quantity (for 2 people): 8/10\nValue for money: Yes\nLocation: 8/10\n\nBecause it\'s a fancy dining place so for me, the variety and presentation seemed more significant than the taste of the food itself. As a food blogger, all aspects are covered though. For me the fact that they presented us with a nice range of palate varying small servings \xe2\x80\x93 enough to fill two people with one platter, was applaudable. They take their sweet time setting up your table, but once they get it ready and bring in the servings, you kind of go nuts digging in. There was enough of everything for everybody.\n\nThe serving was generous, the presentation was eye catching and food tasted pretty good on its own. Its not your regular high tea, it\'s very ""English."" Which is interesting to me, because it seemed they pulled it off quite well. They have a new barista which in turn now serves you great coffee. I think my caf\xc3\xa9 mocha was something I find consistently good at such places. \n\nA few things that stood out for me were \xe2\x80\x93 the tartine with seared beef and horseradish, chocolate plum tart, mango eton mess and the Vietnamese rice paper rolls. The beef was seared medium and had a nice perfect pink right in the center \xe2\x80\x93 which for me is absolutely stunning. The tartine itself was a sort of garlic bread with seared beef on top of it and served with horseradish (which ironically is a very common English dressing used to dress beef, famously in the UK \xe2\x80\x93 surprise surprise at my English reference?) this was actually interesting because it is something niche in the market and the foodies of Karachi deserve diversity in their palate, and it makes me happy to see that there are restaurants trying to put up a good show for everyone. \n\nAnyway, the chocolate plum tart was just off the charts. The crust was crispy, and the tart itself had that perfect balance between the tanginess of the plum and the sweetness of chocolate and it just gave a nice, romantic gesture to your taste buds. \n\nThe mango eton mess is also, an English dessert served in a small cup and was a mixture of broken meringue, whipped cream, tart crumble and mango slices. It was also covered with a little caramel syrup in the end. It was like a little sweet haven in my mouth when I had this.

I'll easily call it the best pizza joint in town. \n-The AC was not working at all and we just sat there sweating away, which was great considering the amount of calories we were going to devour on this cheat day. I had no idea they provided complimentary sauna services too. Thumbs up for that. \n-The place ran completely on self service. We had to even get the cutlery and food ourselves from the counter. Again, the exercise was good for us.\n-We ordered just 1 large pizza (flavour: hot & cold) initially because we wanted to try it first and then order more. And they took only around 40 minutes to prepare it. Have you ever seen a faster service than this? I bet not. \n-Coming to the pizza, the quantity was great. But then I think the restaurant was adamant at not letting us ruin our diet so they made sure to serve us a pizza we are unable to eat. Three grown up guys, who can easily finish 2 large pizzas, ended up with three slices still left of the only 1 large we ordered. In fact, looking around we could see that others also were unable to eat their pizzas. (Or maybe I was just seeing things, after all I was sweating badly and got dehydrated).\n-Bonus: absence of the management was made up by beggars entering the eatery.\n\nTotal cost of 1 large pizza with cold drink came to be RS 450, which I think is quite steep. I mean my gf can make me avoid junk food in free.\n\nTaste 2/10\nService 1/10\nQuality 2/10\nQuantity 7/10""",b'Hassan Ali',,photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1231184670346839&set=gm.1820428504674958&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1820428504674958/',2018-02-18 14:27:17,43,19,1,23,0,1,16,2,1

The previous experience was at brunch but that was excusable, that review will also be posted soon but today was completely unacceptable and disrespectful.\n\nHere's a recap of the situation:\nWe went there for drinks this morning and had decided our order which was mint lemonades. We asked the waiter to take our order thrice and all three times he asked us to wait and that he'll be right back. 20 minutes passed and after waving the manager our order was finally placed and we redeemed our bogo as well. We were patiently waiting for our order for 15 minutes and after that the same server to whom we asked to take our order earlier came to ask if the order was placed. We waited another 20minutes between which we had waved the manager twice and no response was received. Finally, we got up and to leave when the server who took our order asked us what happened I told him the situation and instead of accepting his fault he just went to the counter and plainly cancelled the order without any guilt or apology. \n\nDel Frio trust me your food isn't out class or above average yet I have put up with you in the past but this attitude of today and your overall customer service is pathetic. Never again am I or my team visiting this eatery where the servers aren't trained properly and 50minutes are not enough for you to make simple mint lemonades.\nNo matter how good the food of an eatery is, if the customer service isn't good, nothing is good.\n\n#Ambiance: Well, the seating arrangement isn't that good and the tables aren't even clean and are  close to the dirty walls. \n\n#CustomerService: 0/10\n#Ambiance: 1/10\n\n#Total: 1/20""",b'Syed Muneeb Hussaini',,photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213767504654537&set=gm.1819811118070030&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1819811118070030/',2018-02-18 02:53:45,7,1,0,6,0,0,1,0,0

After enquiring with the management, i was told its imported from India. Well since pak importing potatoes n veggies from their or lekson group which owns McD here might have done on their private terms but question i asked first on their official page before sharing here, How can an International brand who has world most unique, demanded, consumed fries would ever sale completely different style of fries which they are not associated with over the decades? How can this be possible? Where else in the world this happening? Isn't it some kind of transition to replace original slim fires with these fat ones in the future? Hopefully not. Furthermore, when i checked the box it's written 'printed in Pakistan' wow! what an information! For edible/eateries n stuff , it's not important where their boxes are printed, rather some more worthy information for example a product of or / imported from india if that's the case.

I think they have improved in this department. Simply love their pipping hot pita bread which is on the house.

As a faithful member of the Pizza cult in Karachi I write this post with a feeling of triumph at having been treated to simply one of the best Pizza's I have had the fortune of gracing my taste buds. In what can be said as a case of serendipity I stumbled upon, Junaidi's Pizzeria.\nLocated in an inconspicuous street in Badar Commercial is this little shop run by Sohaib Junaidi, a Pizza enthusiast inspired by the $1 slice theme prevalent in New York. For those of you who don't know about the concept, it is quite self explanatory, in that, they sell individual slices for about a dollars equivalent in rupees so its easy on the wallet but ALSO you can even sponsor a slice for a complete stranger by simply paying ahead for a slice and pasting a post-it on the wall with your message and name on it which anyone can come and claim to get a free slice; something the owner feels is a way to create a sense of community, happiness and ofcourse a satisfied tummy.\nComing to the quality of the Pizza itself, the all-important dough was baked to near perfection with just the right amount of crisp and charred texture. The homemade sauce was also spot on, complemented by a fresh layer of cheese and a fairly accurate three way ratio between the toppings, the cheese and the sauce. \nI urge everyone who has even an inkling of fondness for Pizza to treat themselves to JUNAIDI'S, appreciate its concept, and hopefully in the process, revive a waning Pizza culture in Karachi.""",b'Ibad Ather',"b""Photos from Ibad Ather's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214528826000562&set=gm.1716306928420450&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1716306928420450/',2017-11-11 05:24:47,139,37,8,124,11,0,4,0,0

And so, my friend and I had to go check it out. \n\nI ordered the Pulled BBQ Beef for my main course, Kiwi and mint lemonade and a Swiss Choc Brownie topped with a Swiss Choc Ganache and a scoop of gelato along with some macaroons for dessert. \n\nAverage price per head: Less than PKR 1400/- plus tax\n\nOverall ratings: \nTaste: 8.5/10\nQuality: 8/10\nQuantity: 8.5/10\nPresentation: 8/10\nAmbiance: 9/10\nService: 9/10\nLocation: 9/10\n\nAmong many things, service for the restaurant is critical. To my liking the food was served within 15 minutes of the order and although missing the warmth of the plates, the food itself was warm and comforting. The Pulled BBQ Beef is finely shredded slow roasted beef, stuffed in a grilled flatbread with melted cheddar cheese and great balance of spiciness from the BBQ flavor \xe2\x80\x93 served with a hummus and a lettuce, rocket leaves and sun-dried tomato slaw to just sort of balance the acidity from the meat.\n \nIt has tremendous flavor and is a good filling for a growling stomach. You just pick the sandwich up and dip it in the hummus and munch on \xe2\x80\x93 because there\'s just no stopping you then. \n\nThe Kiwi mint lemonade served to be a great tool for digestion, it was a light and refreshing cocktail to go with something so overwhelming as a dish. \n\nAt the end of it all, the most amazing way you can end your dinner is with the Swiss Chocolate brownie, smothered in a melted Swiss Chocolate Ganache served with a homemade scoop of vanilla gelato. It was just rich, creamy, and beats any chocolate lava cake on any day because it doesn\'t bring you down or overpower you into making you feel lazy.\n\nAnd last but not the least, the lovely macaroons. Packed with sugary flavor, the chocolate hazelnut and sea salt caramel macaroon (if you\'re not too much into chocolate) just really helps you run through towards the finishing line of dinner. Amazing. \n\nGreat coffee, good comfort food and a string of amazing desserts with the best possible ambiance anywhere in the city.\n\nFor more food goodies, follow: www.instagram.com/hamzasfoodventures'",b'Hamza Salman Siddiqui',"b""Photos from Hamza Salman Siddiqui's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155849460885269&set=gm.1818920154825793&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1818920154825793/',2018-02-17 07:33:08,35,5,1,34,1,0,0,0,0

165861103465048_1818220638229078,"b'Tonight owing to sudden hunger pangs , decided to go out for dinner. After much delibration , all-time favorite Hot n Spicy Khadda Market branch was selected. Had been a regular customer at their restaurant for quite some years.\n\nPrecisely, ordered 2 crispy broast with garlic mayo dip and steamed rice, however the waiter suggested or rather insisted to try Afghani Pulao. On his \'recommendation\' ordered Afghani Pulao .""The Comedy of Errors"" started as the food  arrived.\n\nThe fries accompanying the broast were totally cold as was the small piece. When I told the waiter , he suggested to deep fry those same fries and piece again ,however on insistence those things were replaced after a good 8 to 10 minutes.  In the meanwhile, the waiter dropped in the middle to inform "" sir fries complimentary nh hn apko pay krna parega"" . I told him to take those on my plate and replace the same with fresh ones. \n\nThe most tragic and pathetic episode was the main piece of broast as I spotted some greenish color on the skin and inside on the meat.( Pics attached). Immediately I asked for the manager. On inquiring he told that it is undercooked\' probably\' and he will replace it and the plate was gone. I, however, suspected of ""mustiness"". At this juncture, I had lost my appetite and asked for the bill . The bill came and the broast didn\'t.  After the waiter was gone with the credit card , another came with the broast which was immensely overcooked. Didn\'t take a bite from it. As we were about to leave, a gentleman came with complimentary desserts . Those were also left untouched by us . To cut it short , if you are planning to visit Hot n Spicy in near future, please avoid ordering Afghani pulao at any cost and examine your food carefully as it might be stale and infested.  It used to be an amazing restaurant but regretfully this time they did not live upto the word.

Something that severely got my attention were the prices. YES!! Just look at the menu card I've posted along with the food pics and go through the extreme low prices - it's indeed worth the praise.\n\nI do believe that their burgers are a lil too juicy. The patty should be a bit more well done (perhaps they should increase the cooking time) for it to have a better combination with the overloaded sauces in the burger.\n\nRating (out of 5):\n\nPresentation: \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\nTaste: \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\nValue for money: \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\nOverall: \xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xad\x90\xef\xb8\x8f""",b'Anam Allahwala',"b""Photos from Anam Allahwala's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1534604316657177&set=gm.1800513799999762&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1800513799999762/',2018-01-30 08:46:07,99,39,1,90,5,3,1,0,0

If you haven't visited it yet, you should definitely give it a try!\n\nSo I will start with what I liked:\n\n1. I LOVE the ambiance and decor! It's ahhmazing \xf0\x9f\x98\x8d (pictures attached)\n2. For a tea and book lover like me, this is the perfect spot. There are comfy couches, dim lights, good music and and a chimney! Matlab pura mahol hai sukun se book parhne k lie (and of course to have tea!) \n3. Their serving sizes are really good! \n4. Their cigar lounge is a separate enclosure. So I don't have to even go through the 'smoking zone' to get to my nonsmoking area. (And I think the privacy is also good for those who want to smoke in peace)\n5. Their fettuccine pasta had the perfect balance of cream and chicken, which is not the case at many other eateries. (I have tried almost har jagah ka pasta tou trust me on this \xf0\x9f\x99\x88)\n6. I also liked their Moroccon chicken and Parmesan chicken in meals.\n7. Their tea is amazing of course but couple it with the super moist French Toast or the Toasty Bites, for savoury lovers and voila! You have the perfect snack \xf0\x9f\x8e\x89\n8. Their Strawberry Fizz is a must try too specially if you have a taste for khatti-meethi drinks.\n9. AND not to forget the 15% discount on check-in and free tea on Tuesday for ladies \xf0\x9f\x99\x88\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy so much:\n1. I have been there 3 times so far and there is always some waiting time.\n2. They don't give the option of French Fries as a side with many dishes \xf0\x9f\x98\x90\n\nAll in all, I have always had a good time at this new place in K-town.""",b'Saman Danish',"b""Photos from Saman Danish's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1663718353684983&set=gm.1800920363292439&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1800920363292439/',2018-01-30 22:19:50,36,18,1,32,3,0,0,0,1

It's a fresh bourgeoish take on the dying Irani cafe breed, with a well thought out iterative menu, and classic interiors.  \n\nThe interior has those rustic old city cafe notes, while the menu is a spin on the usual Desi offerings.  It's got a Desi tapas feel to it.  Order many small portions, and sample it all.  Hari bhari Mirchein, chapli Kebab, Darjan darjan Kebab, aaloo Kebab, and so on.  It's your usual fare with a twist, and a good twist at that.\n\nFlavors were spot on, for whatever we sampled.  The Shahi Tukre being super -- with multiple layers of royalty.  One of the better Shahi Tukre commercially available.  \n\nThe pricing is competitive, with a more value driven approach calling for sampling and sharing a little bit of everything.  Per head cost would be in the range of PKR 700 to PKR 1200, depending on what is ordered. \n\nThe service is a mess though, but it's got those 'teething' issues argument working for it currently.  If the management is able to streamline service, Rustom can be evolve into Sohrab.\n\nOverall -- Chupa Rustom has a solid menu of small plates, and tries to capture that rustic old city feel.  The flavors are on point, while service remains the weakest link.  Rustom is gentrifying South Asian food, something close to home, and is often overlooked. \n\nP.S.

165861103465048_1746802962037513,"b'#TsgBloggerMehak\n\nEatery: Grotto Cafe\n\nVerdict: Praise Cheesus for this Restaurant! From entrees to service, everything is impeccable.\n\nOverall rating. 23/30 (Pretty darn Good!)\n\nThis was my 3rd visit to Grotto, for they are pretty consistent and deliver exactly what they show; unlike eateries that advertise one thing and serve a not so fancy KNOCK OFF.\n\nCheese is the cornerstone of every delicious food, but it\'s also good enough all on its own. Grotto introduced Raclette Cheese and I got all excited to try it asap. \n\nGrotto does amazing steaks which are flavourful, tender and juiciest even if the temperature ordered is well done. I thought of getting Raclette scraped over my favourite entree which was an additional PKR 550/- but I didn\'t.\n\nWhat I Ate? Raclette Platter. Priced at PKR 2200/- this is the BEST THING EVER that serves 2 big eaters and 3 moderate eaters. The cheese was poured over the platter freaking TWICE. Platter included tender and oh so good, thin sliced beef steaks. It included another choice of beef which was more of a rolled up beef joint, stuffed with cheese. This was succulent and well seasoned but I clearly can\'t recall the name as of now. \n\nThe platter also had a oh so yum side of potatoes, mushrooms and a lot of fresh lettuce, carrots, French beans and what not.\n\nThis all, not only added to the beauty, but also to the quality and quantity of serving. \n\nWhat I drank? Mixed Daiquiri. It was a fresh combination of berries and the best possible drink to wash it all down.  \n\nThe only downer was the pungent smell of the Raclette, which was strong and may irritate a few who have hyper anosmia. This was pretty tolerable and could be easily ignored for the Love of cheese. Adding to this, the manager told me about a vacuum machine they are installing in a day or two, to get rid of the smell. This may have been installed already, since I went some 4-5 days ago.\n\nConclusively, the line between ""too much cheese"" and ""not enough cheese"" is blurry at best, so no one\'s allowed to judge you.\n\nQuality: 4/5\nQuantity: 4/5\nPrice: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nAmbiance: 3.5/5\nLocation: 3.5/5'",b'Mehak Shoakat',"b""Photos from Mehak Shoakat's post""",video,b'https://www.facebook.com/1432250037031589/videos/1977536409169613',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1746802962037513/',2017-12-09 02:31:31,402,301,14,348,32,19,2,0,1

165861103465048_1811977802186695,"b""Yesterday I, accompanied by a friend of mine, visited Shaikh's Dine In & Grill, at maskan chowrangi. Ordered chicken maskawa with side line mashed potatoes and rosemary chicken with sideline french fries. While we were fighting over what to order in appetizer, the waiter solved our dispute and advised to order Mandi. Obviously that's not a starter but he advised us to let go the idea of starter and try their newly launched mandi. I personally don't like this cuisine, to be honest. So I refused, upon which he told us it was  complementary for that particular day, as they wanted to get opinion from customers about their attempt to make Mandi. We consented for that and waited for our order. The Mandi was average, to be frank. Rice were of a mediocre taste but the chicken piece kept over it was succulent and palatable. Absolutely toothsome. We gave the honest opinion to them regarding it. When the main courses arrived, they too were savory and lusciously delectable as compared to what is being charged against them. Quantity, in fact, was also more than expectation. Had vouch 365 voucher so got a good deal of discount too. Even if there had been no discount, then also their prices are at the economical side. Good value for money. In the end, had two single scoops of ice cream on account of Facebook check in. Mango flavor was good, but the strawberry one was to die for. An amazingly pleasant and felicitous treat to my sweet tooth. Shall definitely be ordering again whenever I revisit them. Pictures attached for reference, total bill was pkr 900. The waiter, Mr. Sajid Ali, was a nice, friendly and decent guy who guided us through out. Over all a nice experience, shall be revisiting, specially during end of the month days when financial position is generally tight and the mood is to eat something congenial.\nRating;\nAmbiance 9/10\nService 10/10\nFood:\nTaste 9/10\nVFM 9.5/10\nOverall experience 9/10""",b'Ahmar Aleem',"b""Photos from Ahmar Aleem's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157157564883275&set=gm.1811977802186695&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1811977802186695/',2018-02-10 17:30:12,20,4,0,20,0,0,0,0,0

165861103465048_1668611236523353,"b'#TSGBLOGGERHAMZA\n\nEatery: Ambrosia \xe2\x80\x93 Hi Tea (Ambrosia)\n\nVerdict: Great ambiance, fast service but average food taste and quality.\n\nHi teas are on the up and coming these days around Karachi eateries, and every one of the fine dining restaurants is trying to bring the traditional ""English style Hi Tea Experience"" to you. With the likes of the Patio and the Deli, Ambrosia is also one of those that has brought in a similar style of Hi Tea experience. The menu, albeit, different than the rest but the overall experience was just average. \n\nOverall ratings: \n\nTaste/Quality: 6.5/10\nQuantity: 7/10\nPresentation: 8/10\nService: 7/10\nAmbiance: 8/10\nLocation: 8/10\nPer head: 895 + tax\n\nThe platter served, serves two people and the timings for Hi Tea are 4-7pm.\n\nSavories: \n\nTurkey Sandwich \xe2\x80\x93 a multi-grain bread sandwich (single sandwich) cut in half with mayo, iceberg and a piece of frozen off the shelf thin turkey piece. Disappointing. \n\nSmoked Salmon Canape \xe2\x80\x93 a similar multi-grain bread piece sliced in half with, if you looked closely, you\'ll find a small piece of smoked salmon on top with a little spread of mayonnaise. Why even?\n\nTomato and Olive bruschetta \xe2\x80\x93 this was done like it was supposed to be done. Perfect. A nice piece of garlic bread, grilled, topped with salt and generous dressings of tomato and olives. But I had a hard time wrapping my head around why I should have this during tea time? Not something I believe would appeal to general public. \n\nQuiche Lorraine \xe2\x80\x93 the quiche lorraine was exactly what it was supposed to be. A small open crust pastry, savory, filled with egg, cheese and meat. This was rather nice, although inconsistency prevailed in most regarding the amount of egg present. Some of them had an overwhelming amount of egg which made it rather unpleasant to have. \n\nChicken and Mushroom vol au vent \xe2\x80\x93 a nice one bite puff pastry topped with chicken pieces and mushrooms, dressed in mushroom sauce. A delicate and wonderful piece of hi tea savory. \n\nMini Beef Burger \xe2\x80\x93 probably the best thing on the menu. Excellent patty, a soft bun and good enough to go along with the menu. \n\nDesserts: \n\nDark Chocolate Tart \xe2\x80\x93 a very well done dark chocolate, made with consistency and a nice crust at the bottom. \n\nBerry Muffin \xe2\x80\x93 I didn\'t try this, so I\'ll leave this open for comments if you have tried it. \n\nDrinks: \n\nYou get served with either tea/coffee/green tea and an Iced tea \xe2\x80\x93 all your choices. Very standard coffee, nothing too special. \n\nThe presentation was up to the mark, the place was clean, hygienic. The servers there were polite and they had a relatively faster service than most. The restaurant in its own is pleasant place to be if you\'re going there for fine dining. Nicely lit, a very fancy d\xc3\xa9cor and great ambiance. Fall in love with the restaurant once you walk in.\n\nSuggestions: May be change your menu a bit. If you\'re trying to bring in the English Hi Tea experience, might I suggest you try scones as well. Have a separate menu for each week and most importantly, focus on the taste of what you serve. The sandwiches and canape can be brought up a notch. \n\nP.S: I know some pictures might be blurry, I\'m still learning - bear with me.

I wanted a Harry Potter themed cake in short time. I messaged a bunch of people and selected Rumi's Bake Station. Considering I messaged a lot of people, Romesa, the owner of Rumi's was the ONLY person who had excellent customer service. She was extremely kind and collaborated with me. She suggested me to choose cream cake with fondant decorations. I can not thank her enough for that.\nComing to the cake, everything was beyond perfect. The picture I had in my mind of the cake was made into perfection by Romesa. I had chose chocolate fudge as flavour and the taste was delicious. Decorations on the cake were neat and easy to eat.\nRumi's Bakery Station made my brother's birthday a bash tbh.\n\nPS: like I said she has extremely good customer service which just proves how she delivered the cake to my house despite the fact that she had a lot of issues in delivering and I didn't make it easy on her too.\n\nPrice including delivery : Rs. 2000\nRatings: 5/5 \xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f\xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f\xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f\xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f\xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f""",b'Sarah Ahmed',"b""Photos from Sarah Ahmed's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208891694288764&set=gm.1807272392657236&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1807272392657236/',2018-02-06 03:16:42,28,5,0,25,3,0,0,0,0

Maybe not one of the best choices I ever made. \nBeing a seafood lover their menu mainly comprised of different fish items with several components, I wanted to go something off of the average fish and chips and asked the counter service guy for the spiciest thing on their menu to which he recommended their Grilled fish fillet. \n\nGrilled fish fillet: according to them this was the spiciest thing they had on their menu that would suffice for 2 people, It was inclusive of 4 spicy fish fillets and 2 sauces (1 green chutney and the other ketchup) and 1 soft drink can \n\nService: Service was incredibly slow we were asked to wait for 15 minutes even though there was no one else at the counter beside us. But since it was to be prepared 'freshly.' we couldn't question the time limit. After 15 minutes they said to wait for an additional 5-10 minutes as it wasn't ready yet. I was skeptical since fish does not take that long to fry whatsoever plus it wasn't a weekend and there was no rush at all. \n\nPresentation and Taste: Finally we got our order, that consisted of 4 tiny pieces of fish fillets that did look spicy and it was served with two sauces over the side and garnished with a few vegetables. \nWe dived in and well unfortunately the 'spice' affect was limited to the coating of the fish, nonetheless it was pretty bland (which wasn't really expected) the fish pieces were very small and was downright tasteless. \n\nPrice: A small platter of 4 fish fillets + 2 sauces garnished with salad and a can of Pepsi costed me around Rs. 580+ The least they could do is serve their fillets with fries. The quantity definitely wasn't enough for the price they were charging. \n\nAmbience: Since it was a mall and London fries did not have a reserved seating area the ambience was just okay and was kinda noisy. It would be better however If they had reserved their own seating area. \n\nFood: 4/10\nPrice: 4/10 \nAmbience: 4/10\nService: 3/10 \nQuantity: 3/10""",b'Aish Khan',,photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1728184720527648&set=gm.1727484203969389&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1727484203969389/',2017-11-21 09:13:52,6,1,0,3,0,0,3,0,0

When in doubt trust Broadway, always! \n\nOverall rating: 7/10\n\nI was at LuckyOne Mall the other day, and after hours of walking/shopping (caution: if desi mom's say you're going shopping for only an hour, trust me you're not) I was starving and wanted to try something my taste buds were already aware of as I didn't wanna risk my hunger, so I thought what better of an option then pizza itself? Out of all the choices, I stopped at Broadway. 'Lucky' for me Broadway was selling their Large pizza for half the price! \nPIZZA for HALF the price? I couldn't resist.\n\nWestSide Garlic (w/ stuffed crust + 2 extra sauces): Being an Italian cuisine lover- I opted for something creamy, so the person who took my order suggested I go for west side garlic, I trusted him and went for it. \n\nService: Service was slow, considering it was rush hour they told us the order would take 15 minutes but we got it after like 25-30 minutes which is a shame to wait that long for a pizza over dine-in. \n\nPresentation and Taste: After the long wait I couldn't wait to dive in, the pizza was fresh out of the oven, looked great and it was piping hot. The stuffed crust was full of sauce and the crust was quite thin, light and airy just the way I liked. Toppings were sufficient enough and there was a lot of flavor, not to mention the  heavenly cheese strings in every bite! The suggestion was pretty good as the pizza was quite saucy and I loved the fact that you can actually feel the garlic and it's not just any other fancy name, the garlic and ranch sauce served with the pizza was a cherry on top- smooth consistency and great flavor. \n\nPrice: The entire large pizza and additional sauces for the price of Rs. 650 instead of Rs. 1300 is definitely a keeper, Broadway surely has earned yet another customer in terms of taste- undoubtedly one of the best Pizza's in Town.  \n\nAmbience: The seating area reserved for Broadway however was pretty small and the area was very crowded. \n\nFood: 7.5/10\nPrice: 10/10\nAmbience: 3/10\nService: 4/10""",b'Aish Khan',"b""Photos from Aish Khan's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1715507868462000&set=gm.1713795375338272&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1713795375338272/',2017-11-08 13:18:16,23,6,0,21,1,0,0,1,0

Little did I know I'm not going to be receiving a meal worth the money I payed for. \nAs the name suggests the entire menu consisted of desi food, from thalis to street food, everything was present. \nI didn't wanna go any different or take any chances, so I opted for the Chana chaat\n\nChana Chaat: Now this particular tiny plate consisted of 2 spoonfuls of Chanas, yoghurt, chopped onions and topped with chaat masala and papri, I also ordered a drink along with it surprisingly they had no cans or bottles available but instead they had their own plastic cups- which I would be completely fine with considering the fact that many fast food chains do the same. But it's the just the size and the price that got to me. \n\nService: Well considering that it was street food, they had everything prepared over the counter and the guy just had to assemble a 'few' components and that was it. However we did tell him to prepare it while we wandered around in search of more food, when we came back they didn't prepare anything because 'they awaited our presence.' \n\nPresentation and Taste: finally it was time to dig in! I was really curious to taste that tiny little plate thought it might be full of flavor, sadly there wasn't much going on,    I couldn't Get the 'desi street food.' Feel, there weren't enough components and chutneys especially for the price they were charging! \n\nPrice: The chaat costed me Rs. 180 along with a drink of Rs.100, total bill being 280. All I can say is the quantity definitely wasn't enough for the price they were charging. \nAnd Who even charges that much for a tiny glass of drink? \n\nAmbience: Since it was a mall and ChachaJee did not have a reserved seating area the ambience was just okay and was kinda noisy.

Why is this place so over-hyped? \n\nOver all rating: 3/10\n\nI was at lucky one Mall the other day where I was craving some ice cream, thought about trying 'HeyDay.' Since it's definitely the talk of the town for some odd reason. \nWent through their menu, looked absolutely scrumptious, the details, the ice creams and the sundaes. \n\nI went for the 'Banging Brownie.' Considering the reviews and well.. Who doesn't love Chocolate? \n \nService: I placed my order and waited like 5 minutes for them to load my icecream which was fine till when the rest of my family had to wait for an additional 10-12 minutes while I had almost finished my icecream. Also note there was no rush at all. \n\nPresentation: I'll be honest, it looked absolutely amazing. The loaded icecream was every chocoholic's dream come true. \n\nTaste: After 2-3 bites, all I could taste was utter disappointment. The Ice cream legit had no flavor, the consistency was super watery and it felt like it had been made in water rather than milk, there was no 'cream' in that ice cream. \nNo smooth and silky textures. Rather just plain chocolate ice cream full of ice crystals. Definitely the perfect example for 'Don't judge a book by its cover.' It had all the things in it to be a show stopper, but when it comes to taste honestly it felt like the local ice-creams you get that's usually sold over the streets. The toppings kept falling off, was way too messy. The worst part was that the brownie and nuts were all on top inside it was just plain chocolate ice cream. \n\nPrice: The ice-cream costed me Rs. 250. If they're really charging that much for their 'ice-cream.' I honestly wouldn't want to pay a single penny for that, but with the over loaded toppings it was just below average. \n\nService: 2/10\nPrice: 3/10\nPresentation: 5/10\nTaste: 2/10""",b'Aish Khan',,photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1786515144694605&set=gm.1788249541226188&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1788249541226188/',2018-01-18 14:17:10,79,41,0,74,4,1,0,0,0

She kept yelling over the fone and stopped listening mid way. Anyhow she told me that there is no commitment of time as to when food will be delivered to you and it can take upto 3 hours. I was okay with that since we were not that hungry that time.\n\nWhen 2 hours went by i called them just to inquire the status of my order. I guess it was the same lady again and she again very rudely said we never did any commitment of time. I told her that i am just simply asking the status. So she said rider will come to you in some time. Like she was doing some ehsaan by sending order and i am some begger asking for food.\n\nWhen the food arrived. I was so so disappointed with the quantity of the food. \n\nI ordered:\n1-Dynamite prawns\n2- Classic chicken chilli dry (single serving)\n3- Chicken chilli (single serving)\n4- Mix rice (family)\n\nFirstly she sent 8pc +4pc prawns whereas i orderd 8pc only.\n\nThe most dissapointing thing was the quantity of the food. Normally a single serving is more than enough to fill up 2 people's stomachs. However, the classic chicken and cherry chill was in such less quantity that it was barely enough for one person. There were literally only a bunch of chicken pieces. Cherry chicken had the similar situation. \n\nGinsoy should have mentioned that they will cut down the quantity of the food by 60% in discount deals so at least customers don't get manipulated by their so called discount. \n\nI am not gona lie, food taste was yummy as usual. Classic chicken chilli was great and so were prawns. \n\nI am gona attach the pictures of single serving that i ordered today Vs the single serving i ordered at their outlet when i visited them a week ago before any discounts and you can see it for yourself. \n\nMy only complain is Ginsoy don't cheat your customers because someone like me who really love ginsoy and visit often feel so betrayed and it makes me question the ethics of the brand.""",b'Aleya Awan',"b""Photos from Aleya Awan's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211135087794975&set=gm.1812553608795781&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1812553608795781/',2018-02-11 09:58:04,66,32,0,54,0,3,1,2,6

You won't get anything like this in Karachi, and that much I promise you. \n\nOverall Rating: 9/10 \nAverage hit: PKR 2500/- \n\nLocated literally at the East End of the city, off Khalique uz Zaman road (Punjab chowrangi), nestled in a bushy corner \xe2\x80\x93 this place welcomes you with serious home feels. Coveted with a nice parking space right outside the place, upon stepping out of your car you'll notice a giant crow with a wooden background awaiting your welcome. \n\nIt's a small, cozy place, with a very comfortable ambiance, well lit and a plush interior. The first look is welcoming, and you see waiters in crisp whites bringing you two menus \xe2\x80\x93 signatures and specials. \n\nThe way it goes is something like this \xe2\x80\x93 in a five-course meal you only order your main course and you get 03 appetizers with it, 04 seasonal fruit drinks (shot glasses with slushy texture) and then at the end a dessert of your choice. You start off with a chilled detox water consisting of beetroot, lemon and mint and then your appetizers start coming in along with your drinks. \n\nThe appetizers are crafted according to your entr\xc3\xa9e's styling. We were a bunch of 4 people so we ended up trying all their appetizers: chilies stuffed with mixed spicy pickle with flour based crackers to just soothe the spice, sweet boiled potato with crispy paapar and a chilly based dressing, boiled potato dressed in mint yogurt with fried egg plant and assortment of dressings, cannoli type sweet potatoes with herbs and tamarind sauce, three different types of bite sized parathas (sweet, savory and spicy), BBQ fried prawns, flour based twisted rolls stuffed with minced beef and tamarind sauce. \n\nYes, I just finished the list of the appetizers. Each one of them had a superb unique taste and it would be unfair to differentiate them on basis of taste. Just to make things clear, one person gets three appetizers, so you might just get 03 of those appetizers depending on what you ordered. \n\nFinally, here's a list of my breakdown ratings: \n\nTaste: 9/10\nQuality: 9/10\nQuantity: 9.5/10\nPresentation: 9/10\nAmbiance: 8/10\nLocation: 7/10 (difficult to locate, unless you're using google maps) \nValue for money: 7.5/10\n\nMy main course was a classic Burn's Road Khatakat \xe2\x80\x93 served with garlic parathas. I am not much of a heavy eater and because of the whole list of appetizers being presented, I had to give up on my main course midway. Which made me realize that five course meals aren't my thing, lol. But the dish in itself was sublime. Perfectly spiced khatakat, well balanced flavors, less oil, generously served and just went very well with the whole meal. \n\nThe drinks they served were an imli and gur slush, kiwi slush, mint lemonade slush, orange juice slush, and a pomegranate and black pepper slush \xe2\x80\x93 all shot sizes. \n\nAt the end, you have a choice of gajar ka halwa, khajoor ka halwa, malpuris, and kulfi. For me the khajoor ka halwa was superb. I would get that on top of any other dessert, any given day. \n\nLong story short, this place is an experience of an own. If you have the budget, and someone you want to impress, then well \xe2\x80\x93 this place won't let you down. \n\nFor more food goodies, follow me on: www.instagram.com/hamzasfoodventures""",b'Hamza Salman Siddiqui',"b""Photos from Hamza Salman Siddiqui's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155836118260269&set=gm.1813782572006218&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1813782572006218/',2018-02-12 10:23:00,51,14,2,49,1,1,0,0,0

Sadly she was right this time :) \nSo here is the sad story \nWent to the restaurant ordered their best dishes which were triple cheese Salisbury steak and classic sobremsa pizza. \nThe pizza looked so so good BUT we had to use steak knife to cut the crust i like was like WTF and called the waiter, asked him should the crust be this hard like this? *see in the video below* He said no sir we are sorry may be the oven temperature was not set right. I was like Ok now what but no action was taken :(and the 45 min I waited just for the pizza were down the drain. \nNow coming to the triple cheese STEAK \xf0\x9f\x98\xad\xf0\x9f\x98\xad which only had single cheese in it  and in such less quantity did not impress me AT ALL. Btw it was a mince patty  not an actual steak, I knew it already so didn\'t matter.Moral of the story is that this place sucks big time no customer care and I had to pay 1500 rupees for their mistake in form of the so-called deep dish pizza. \nI saw a video on this group of the steak\n where cheese was oozing  out when you cut it but sadly I did not witness this in reality.\n""Just a message to the restaurant owner in this group promoting your restaurant is good but at least provide what you promote""'",b'Muhammad Ahmed',"b""Photos from Muhammad Ahmed's post""",video,b'https://www.facebook.com/10152088656206818/videos/10155371756146818',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1811518868899255/',2018-02-10 07:54:37,42,29,0,36,0,0,2,4,0

165861103465048_1813936258657516,"b""Sooo i am one of those lucky persons who availed the 49% off on Ginsoy. We reached there at 8.30 so the representative told us to wait 40 minutes but she was kind enough that she called us in 10 minutes. The ambiance was little messy just because of the discount they're offering. \nSo we ordered 4 items which were prawn balls, beef fried rice, beef mangolian and American chopseuy. \n\nThe first thing we ate was the prawn balls and it was totally totallyyyyyy divine. I mean it was beyond perfect. I am a hugee fan of prawn and those prawn balls totally made my day 10/10 for prawn balls. Highly recommended \n\nThe second thing was American chopseuy which was a total failure. I won't recommend it to anyone just because it has noooo taste. No chicken n beef element. I won't order it ever in my life tbh. 2/10 for chopseuy. (2 numbers for the egg at the top which was yummy) \n\nThe third thing was Mangolian beef. I am utterly in love with this dish. My taste buds were shouting delicious. And it was totally complementing the beaf fried rice. A big thumbs up for mangolian beef 10/10\n\nThe fourth and the last thing is beef fried rice which were yummy. The aroma of the rice was like Wowww. And most importantly the quantity of the rice. I ordered single fried rice and 3 persons ate from it easily. 9/10\n\nTge the total damage was 1433. But when i read the general sales tax it was 13% like isn't it too much? They wrote that they're applying 7% but when the bill came 13% tax was applied on that. Its a big disappointing thing. It means they're offering a discount of 36% ? They should write this thing in the terms and conditions. \n\nAnyways if i ignore the bill stuff it was a fine experience.""",b'Mohammad Ahmed',"b""Photos from Mohammad Ahmed's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1840551305990232&set=gm.1813936258657516&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1813936258657516/',2018-02-12 13:53:01,24,8,0,24,0,0,0,0,0

And Sultan comes on top of the list.\nI have hosted two parties over there and everytime my experience has been exceptional. The very first time I planned to host a dinner there, I was very hesitant (it being a new eatery) and called them first. The person who spoke to me, Umer, was a gentleman and eased all my qualms. He guided my about the dishes and made sure my guests were attended well. The second time the service was equally good. The waiters were attentive and kept asking if everything was upto the standards.\nThe best thing I like about this place is the quality of food. The main highlights for us are: shahi mutton pulao, malai boti, palak paneer, achari handi and chicken tikka karhai. The food is really really good! And the ambience is perfect for formal gathering.\nThis time i cancelled an item from my order as the food was quite enough and i found out after coming home that they hadn't removed it from my bill. Although it was a genuine mistake from their part but the guy Umer apologised and was not only ready to refund the amount but he also offered to drop it off at my place.\nAll in all they truly know how to make a customer happy. I have become their loyal customer and I hope they maintain their standard in the long run.\nP.S. Since I didn't get time to take pictures, I'm attaching the pictures from their page.

The service is good though, and people like the theatrics -- so why not.\n\nThe tenderloin steak was bad.  Served Medium, with a layer of cheese on top, it eventually morphed into Bihari Kebab.  The type of Bihari Kebab you make on third day of Eid, while you're an amateur -- and are then pushed away by family because you're screwing everything up. They may rename it to Bihari Steak.\n\nThe lasagna was devoid of any layers, with lots of qeema.  The burger was ordinary, much better options available elsewhere.  Massive portions don't always mean good flavors, and that was the case here.\n\nAverage cost is around PKR 1000 per head, and service is prompt.\n\nOverall -- Meat the Cheese didn't live up to the expectations, or the hype.

I went there last saturday with my husband and ordered their burger and a steak (btw, they just have one item each on their menu for steak and beef burger).

Obviously we wanted to eat together!  My husband had called the waiter numerous times to ask where the steak was! Finally when they were willing to answer our query, one of the servers came to our table to inform that they had 'forgotten' to prepare the order of steak ! .. and it will arrive soon. Obvioulsy, when the steak finally arrived the burger had gone cold, to which they said if we bring you a new one you'll have to wait again and the steak will go cold :/ .  thank fully they heated it up (atleast) and altho i had planned to ask for the cheese topping which they're so famous for, I was in such a bitter mood until then, that i totally didnt feel like it, at all! thanks Meat the Cheese for ruining our lunchdate :(   (which we rarely go out for, as we have three kids).

I normally go to buy bread & rusk from a nearby United Bakery Branch. On last Firday upon my regular grocery shopping I saw a similar cake on the display, when I asked about the rates oh my, oh my, rates were really pocket friendly! finally ended up booking a cake with Doll shape & in chocolate fudge flavor. When I got back home\n& told my family regarding it, everyone started giving me all kinds of negative comments regarding United Bakery that they have quality issues & their cream is artificial & spheric. Till Sunday ( Event day) I was really much tormented by all these comments but when I picked up the cake & looked it my confidence was regained & the result you can see in the pictures below not only it looks amazing it was really yummy both from outside & inside. The size looks small but it was quite heavy, we served it to 36 guests at the party and more than 1/4 was left. Lets see who can guess the correct price of this cake?

165861103465048_1809284582456017,"b'-\n\nLast Sunday I visited Bloomsbury Caf\xc3\xa9 solely and entirely based on the reviews that I read about its breakfast\xe2\x80\xa6 apparently it was one of the best Cafes for breakfast. Here\'s my experience.\n\nAmbiance:  It is a fusion of modern caf\xc3\xa9 and classic design. What I really like about the interior that it is not showy and exudes elegance. It is a cozy place with comfortable seating (baring two that are placed with the pillars).\nStaff is friendly and diligent. \n\n9/10 for the ambiance.\nFood: I ordered ""The English Platter"" \xe2\x80\xa6 it offers two fried eggs, a bacon, sausages, CROISSANT, beans, butter, jelly, breads and a hash brown.  A pretty good deal for Rs.520 without tax. \n\nThe fried eggs were nicely presented. However, the yolk was slightly overcooked and wasn\'t exactly runny. Croissant (my major reason for ordering this) was fresh and yummilicous. Hash browns also tasted good and so did the bacon. Sausages were okay, not that good but not bad either. \nI think if the yolk was not overcooked, I would have given it a good rating. But since it wasn\'t, I would only give it 6.5/10.\n\nMy friend tried Eggs Benedict Turkey and thought turkey was pretty salty but rest of it was good. It was for Rs. 570. \n\nDrinks: Since tea perks me up and I can\'t start a day without a cup of tea, I was slightly disappointed when I saw it on the menu that they only offer black tea or a shot of vanilla/choc etc in it. However, when I told the manager that I wanted to have a mix cup of tea (means with milk in it), he happily agreed and told me that it can be arranged. \n\nTea was good and strong. It was for Rs. 140 without Tax, I think it is reasonable.\n\nTotal damage: Rs. 1492.\n\nVerdict: Recently, I have tried a lot of new places but most of them turned out to be a damp squid, however, this one is added to the list of my ""go-to"" places because it is nice, cozy and offers reasonably good food. \n\nI would give it 8/10. \n\n#bloomsburycafe'",b'Syeda Abida Bookhari',"b""Photos from Syeda Abida Bookhari's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155572596918285&set=gm.1809284582456017&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1809284582456017/',2018-02-08 05:02:30,113,43,2,97,9,1,6,0,0

I had asked for the pizzas to be delivered at 8:30PM Sharp and to my delight they arrived on time which is a big BIG plus for any delivery joint! So for delivering it on time I give them a 10/10.\n\nBoth the pizzas were piping hot, the Mexican Pizza had a very distinct and unique flavour and lived up to the Mexican name as the hotness/spice factor was on point. Though they could've used a bit more cheese in this one so I would rate this a 7/10.\n\nThe bbq chicken pizza was a definite hit with the family! Ample chicken, ample cheese and enough mushrooms and olives as well as some sweet corn on top of this pizza added to its rich flavour..and of course the cheese sauce accompanying it complemented the flavour perfectly! (Going to be ordering this one on a regular basis) so it definitely deserves a 9/10.\n\nThe two pizzas (10 inches) came as part of a deal which was priced at PKR 999 which is a steal considering the price factor and the two pizzas were enough for 4 people. \n\nAccompanying the pizzas was also the Nutella Banofee Pie (complimentary) which proved to be the perfect end to this meal!""",b'Reeda Sheikhani',"b""Photos from Reeda Sheikhani's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155997465933361&set=gm.1811931968857945&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1811931968857945/',2018-02-10 16:31:41,10,2,0,10,0,0,0,0,0
165861103465048_1544084292309382,"b""#TSGBLOGGERANASKHAN\nVenue : Chaupal Desi Exotic Buffet\nDate : 31st May 2017\n\nEating out and raving about food has never been my forte. I'm that person who goes out not to enjoy scrumptious delicacies but to be immersed in the ecosystem of the restaurant and then eat whilst keeping a sharp eye on the service.\n\nNow, a planned event with the fellow Swoggers led me to Chaupal. If I would be extremely honest, I did not carry any subliminal persuasions to go visit that place by any means and had obvious reasons for that.\n\nAnyways, let's discuss Chaupal. I didn't know what that mean and googling it suggested that it's called ' Open Community Space'. I reached the venue just at Iftar time, gave the car on valet and hopped straight in towards the reception.\n\nNow as they say, ' You never get the second chance, to make a great first impression ' and the lady at the reception nailed that immaculately. Let me elucidate how ?\n\nUsually you go to a place, they ask for table / reservation et cetera. Though, that lady didn't do anything like that. What she did was more wonderful to me than anything else. Before even uttering a word, she offered me to sit down and brought a plate of 'Khajoors' to open the Iftar. Probably this act might sound a bit normal to you lot, but as I reiterate again, for me eating food is probably the last thing on the list at the Restaurant. I go out to meet new people, get acquainted with the decor and theme of the restaurant and to divulge into the logic of the designer, food artist, menu specialist, owner's perspective  and most importantly - to fathom upon the reason what made them people setup this restaurant on the first place, because it cannot be just commercialised stuff behind setting up a restaurant which can cater more than 200 people with plethora of food options from BBQ, CHINESE, SEA FOOD, THAI, ITALIAN, DELI ITEMS, IFTAR ESSENTIALS & OTHER SWEET / SAVOURY SNACKS.\n\nComing back to Khajoors now, I had a few of them, to get my ample share of ( Dietary Fiber, Vitamin B6 & Folate). Upon finally entering the main food court, I was greeted by my lovely fellow SWOGGERS i.e Maha Mamoon & Arham whilst the infamous Reza Merchant who never fails to keep check on me if I have arrived, truly love that gent much.\n\nAt that moment, most people were sat on their tables and enjoying their scrumptious food. It gave me an opportunity to have a stroll around the buffet area and see what the buzz is all about and I assure you, that I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe food was sizzling from everywhere, the chefs were all wearing hats and aprons and hygiene was top notch. I noticed hand sanitisers available at every nook and cranny and different tongs were placed delicately beside every food item. It's extremely critical and was much pleasing for me to observe that, because I have severe Shellfish allergy, i.e an intolerance of Prawn, Fish or any seafood being on its own or mixed with any item even by a hint.\n\nI admired the whole structure of Chaupal. The centre lobby has all traditional items from Biryani, Qorma, Karahi, Pulao, Sajji, Mutton Ghost, Palak Paneer, then it further extends to Italian wing with all the Pastas, Tarragon Chicken, Spaghetti Bolognese and then concluding it to the Sea Food enclosure containing Fried Fish, Prawns, oh there was ample Tartar sauce too there.\n\nBut after monitoring all those enclosures, I headed to my favourite and only point of interest; the BBQ AREA and in my sheer white plate, I poured Reshmi Kebabs, Malai Boti into it. You know when you pour Malai Boti from the spoon or spatula, it gets so sticky on it and you have to bang it on your plate to let go of those Botis, trust me I didn't have to do that. It poured nicely and gently and didn't resist at all, like the Malai Boti knew she was made for me and greeted me with her arms wide open. Okay melodramatic much, though pardon me if I get emosh much with BBQ (Proteins and Gains if you know..)\n\nNow with my plate sorted, I headed on the upper wing to meet the rest of the SWOGGER TEAM, most didn't know me due to obvious reasons but still I sat with the lovely acquaintances and finally started my food. It had been only a minute or two passed and I see well dressed gentlemen coming to me and inquired about what drinks I would like, I requested only water and within a minute a bottle was presented to me.\n\nThe food tasted superb, all the BBQ items were marinated properly and were not rushed on the grill and as most Buffet restaurants do, loading up the containers to the brim, I didn't find that at Chaupal. The chefs there were strictly cooking and replenishing on ad hoc basis, which I found so attractive that everything you were being fed was so fresh and straight from the pan or grill, depends whatever you were eating. The photo attached can elaborate a bit of the peculiar interest I have in Food not.\n\nOnce done with the BBQ, I headed down to offer Salah and was pleased to observe a nice cosy Mosque on the corner with Wudu facilities as well, These things are worth mentioning because these MATTER to me a lot, because focusing on the human element of any business can never ever be detrimental and that's what Chaupal has offered me.\n\nFOOD (8/10): Exemplary, everything was divine, nothing unprecedented happened. The whole experience was extremely polite, stress free and handled all with perfection by the Manager who was continuously monitoring everything.\n\nQUALITY & TASTE (18/20): Exotic enough to evoke my memories of the amazing bbq I used to have with the lads back during summers at Hyde Park.\n\nPRICE (10/10): At 999 Rs, nothing beats that. I could suggest everyone, specially families to go there. It's probably the finest not just in terms of the best bargain, but a wide array of food options catering needs of all, even children.\n\nMENU SELECTION (8/10):  Pretty admirable, as stated above. You'd spend a good few minutes drooling across food being cooked, in my case Sajji was the personal best. Like you could see it roasted in front of you and the chef would dice it into pieces, top it up with lemon zest and hint of paprika. A must try item indeed.\n\nLOCATION (5/5): Exceptional, located on Main Karsaz. Parking is a bit of choas, but where it isn't in Karachi? Got Valet available.\n\nAMBIANCE / SERVICE / HYGIENE/ FOOD PRESENTATION ( 18/20)\n\nIt's an outdoor restaurant with the ground floor has roofing and fans options, the upper area doesn't have any Fans as of yet, which was bit of a lethargic dilemma, as Karachi's weather hasn't been very polite since some time now and humidity was killing. But still, It didn't stop the waiters and other house keeping staff to be in their top behaviour and served us in the finest way possible. \n\nHygiene was strictly adhered to as well, with the used plates been taken by the staff promptly and also fresh cutlery was readily available.\n\nFood presentation was immaculate too, I do not posses photos but they did carvings on several seasons fruits and the dessert section was also colourful enough \nto attract a large chunk of audience.\n\nTotal A: 47/50\nTotal B: 23/25\n\nOverall score : 70/75\n\nSuffice to say, Chaupal deserves an applause, not just by catering splendid food but also the level of top notch service standards set by them. It was one of the kind places, I left happily and kept contemplating about it on my drive back home. That is, the whole experience, the essence of our desi food and pride associated with it. I wish the management all the best for their future endeavours and keep up the immaculate job.""",b'Anas Khan',"b""Photos from Anas Khan's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158779219590084&set=gm.1544084292309382&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1544084292309382/',2017-06-04 06:47:47,94,58,2,87,6,1,0,0,0

The place is so mismanaged. The servers are beyond rude and they misbehaved with me even when it was their mistake. They have a biggg board that says cards accepted but their machine does not work. The cashier swiped my card the other way round twice which shows how untrained she was. She did not know who to use or operate the machine. The rest of the staff arrived conveniently an hour late. They later accused me for having an invalid card which is not possible since i used it an hour before visiting kunafa and it was working. I even showed them the receipt of my last purchase. Its a shame to see how rude these people can be to  hide their mistake.  \n\nUpon getting angry, they forced me to leave. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE your time and effort on a place that is so pathetic. The management really needs to learn a few customer services lessons. They seemed to be downright ill-mannered and unwilling to serve.

165861103465048_1810469749004167,"b""The Valley - A review long overdue! \n\nHappened to try this fairly new eatery few weeks back but our experience wasn't as good as we thought it would be after entering the venue.\n\nAmbiance first; simply loved being seated there! It's a homely and a very cosy place to dine out with an indoor and outdoor setting both. They do special arrangements for birthday parties, bridal showers etc and have a private area as well that you can book to have your own space totally. Their courtyard is pretty much fancied up, good newsss for all the people who love taking pictures! ;)  \n\nMoving on to food, they have a pretty extensive menu which includes Pakistani cuisine as well. Impressive! We ordered Chicken and Mushroom Soup and Nachos as starters. The Valley Grilled Chicken, Tuscany Pasta, and Pepperoni Pizza as main courses.\n \nSoup had profuse amount of chicken and mushroom; it was very close to the one available at Hobnob Express. Loved scraping the bread bowl. Price and quantity justified! \n\nNachos were totally off, I have had much better nachos else where. \n\nWe had Xander's and Bloomsbury's pizza in mind, were craving for something like that but this pizza left us utterly disappointed. Least liked dish of the day. It costed us Rs. 875+tax, tasted more like an ordinary bakery pizza and was even smaller than the standard regular size. \n\nTuscany Pasta was better in all the main dishes we ordered. \n\nTheir Grilled Chicken had nothing special in it, just the usual grilled fillets with a very mediocre tasting sauce. \n\nMy friend wasn't a fan of their peach tea either!\n\nAll in all, this place is great if you want to arrange small-scale events and food is not your top priority.

165861103465048_1808514692533006,"b'Sometimes, some people here make me laugh - not at some good jokes, but their silly complaints and cries. The other day I saw a post about someone complaining about the price of a sandwich and even coming down to prices of individual food items. First and foremost, did you NOT know the price in the first place? If you did read so in the menu, in NO WAY is the restaurant to be blamed except for the quality and taste (which, is a genuine issue and to which this post is not related). Or did they suddenly come up and tell you something like ""hello sir/ma\'am, we just raised price of that very burger you ordered by 200%, 30 seconds ago, and you have to pay for it""?\n\nDo you guys even realize the restaurant owners are not only supposed to make some profit (no they don\'t have families to support, of course) and pay wages, but they have invested huge amounts in the business for you to show up, get to occupy seats in their limited space, and enjoy the free air-conditioned and comfortable environment? Just now I saw another post complaining about the price of a mineral water bottle. For capitalism\'s sake! Are you guys even serious? That\'s how the world works! If you want the bottle for the same price, what\'s the difference between having invested in a small corner shop and a big restaurant? Why would they spend so much money and hire so many employees (thus make jobs for these same people who complaint unnecessarily)?\n\nTalk some sense, will you? If you are really worried about the high prices, then well n good - save your hard earned money and also support the less financially stable by purchasing that mineral water or sandwich from your nearby shop/restaurant. You can simply not visit \'that expensive restaurant\' in the first place if you genuinely believe they are looting you and that would be a sane decision to make.'",b'Ahsen Sindhi',,status,,b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1808514692533006/',2018-02-07 09:30:11,62,14,0,52,6,1,3,0,0

So with all the savings, I finally decided to try the restaurant with the roots from Lahore... HOWDY'S at LuckyOne Mall..\n\nAmbiance 8/10\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was amazing because of it's American wild west's theme with all those cowboy hats and fancily styled interior and outdoor seating. Despite all this, the restaurant was filled with smoke for some reason which forced us to leave the indoor and to sit outside... \xf0\x9f\x98\x94\n\nFood 8/10\nComing to the food, the menu was fancily designed, or it was rather ciphered with complex styling. We were a group of 5, so we ordered 3 steaks and 2 burgers. I ordered a steak for myself; one thing I didn't read in menu was that the steaks were of chicken \xf0\x9f\x98\x90.... Def my mistake... But, surprisingly, the grilled chicken turned out to be great. It was the Desperado Steak. Properly grilled without being dry topped ( or what you wanna call it) with the jalapeno sauce and a side of mashed potatoes did make it a reasonable combo... I would have called it amazing but the price tag it had was a whopping 849 Rs ( or bucks as written on their menu... I'm glad i didn't have to pay that amount in dollars). Keeping money aside, it was amazing..

Located at Gulshan (near Karachi University), it was good in terms of the ambiance and location. Furthermore, they plan on opening up another branch in the near future and also plan on providing deliveries, which will be a great addition. \n\nMoving on to the food, we started with an excellently prepared appetizer, Crispy Chicken Poppers. They were scrumptious. \n\nFor the main dish, we opted for three different types of burgers; Jalapeno Royal, Mushroom Cheese and Portland Winner\n\nOut of the three, Mushroom Cheese was the winner as it was absolutely mouthwatering. The patty was juicy and flavorsome while the sauce was just the right amount. As for the Jalapeno Royal, that too was delicious, and couldn't be flawed. However, the Portland Winner, I wouldn't say was a disappointment, however did have a few flaws. Firstly, the burger was way too saucy, and second, the patty wasn't as well done as compared to the other burgers we had tried. In my opinion, reducing the amount of sauce used would definitely compliment the burger much more. \n\nOverall, the experience was truly satisfying considering the reasonable prices in regard to the serving size and the luscious food. I would highly recommend this place to everyone and specially all the millennials out there.""",b'Azlan Allahwala',"b""Photos from Azlan Allahwala's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159905755200015&set=gm.1804421979608944&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1804421979608944/',2018-02-03 06:24:44,221,82,2,209,10,2,0,0,0

And what can be better when you can avail some good offers. I got Mud and Malteser Cakes, both were good and had a good amount of chocolate to satisfy your cravings for chocolate. Overall loved their packaging, it is done with black and gold to give a royal look. Box itself looks like a present! I availed my bogo.pk app voucher and of course got another cake absolutely free.\n\nMud Cake: It was a bit dry not that moist as it looked and as it should be but it tasted good. Cake design was nicely done, neat work! And it had balanced amount of sweetness. \n\nMalteser Cake: It was really rich and gooey, super moist too! But there were no Malteser inside the cake, only five used for decor! It would be really good if they would have added few crushed Malteser inside as well to give it a proper Malteser touch and taste.'",b'Afifa J Maniar',"b""Photos from Afifa J Maniar's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1650377341710723&set=gm.1808495179201624&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1808495179201624/',2018-02-07 11:42:03,13,2,1,13,0,0,0,0,0

It is cafe offering the people of Karachi an opportunity to experience a distinctive taste of street food from around the world. \n\nNow for the first time in Pakistan, we have opened our basement for 'guests'. By guests, we mean the talented youth of this country which desperately needs an avenue to showcase their talents live in front of a decent crowd for which our basement will be available every weekend. \nI believe that our country has immense ability plus expertise in the fields of music, standup comedy, and karaoke open mic. This humungous amount of talent which has been unexplored if directed in the right way can outshine the name of our country. I also think that the reason why our country is lacking behind our neighbors in the aforementioned fields is the lack of availability of platforms which encourage them selflessly to refine their skills and by providing such, we at OUAT will try to do the minimum contribution we can do to our motherland as it will be open for all from this Independence day. So, all the talented juvenile out there can walk in and show what they got every weekend at our cafe. \nAnyone and everyone is welcome without any discrimination!.  \nSo please Come and support us.\n\nContact me for further details and slot bookings.\n03222888088/03331207865 or just inbox us on our facebook page.\n\nFriday: Comedy Nights\nSaturday: Open Mic for Everyone\nSunday: Music Night\n\nP.S Our basement is also available for private bookings like birthdays, seminars and any kind of celebration in accordance with our rules and regulations.\n\n#OUATBasement""",b'Faiz Ur Rehman',"b""Photos from Faiz Ur Rehman's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1405822042806996&set=gm.1628801427171001&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1628801427171001/',2017-08-14 13:02:39,210,51,6,185,16,9,0,0,0

I ordered the milk chocolate flavor which is supposed to be her best! When we did finally cut the cake, it turned out to be very moist and chocolaty on the inside. Everybody loved it!!! The best part about the owner is that she delivers the cake on her own and does not rely on any delivery service which was a shock and when the cake arrived in the perfect condition, it was a relief!

I am sorry i wasnt able to click some snaps as we were damn hungry and when the pizza arrived we were like halla bolll, the pizza was fresh, dough perfectly prooved, topping was amazing and the taste was awesome. On sunday i had to go at my friends place so i thought of a take away from Pizza Romeesa and also i was curious to meet the owner and inquire about the story behind the name, luckily he was at the branch i first ordered my take away and then on my request the owner himself came to meet me after some greetings when i inquired abt the name he told me that Romeesa is his youngest daughter and he wanted to start this new venture on the name of his daughter (Betian Allah ki rehmat he said) This was the Gulshan branch opp Metro The dine inn facility is available but needs some development thou.

After waiting for 10 minutes to get a table, the manager told us that we could sit inside the room which is at the back side and pretty aloof but since there was no other option we agreed. While we were walking to this ""room"", we saw empty tables on the porch and the waiter and manager said we could sit there if we wanted. So anyway, we sat on a table on the porch area and even before we could give our order, some other waiter or manager (not sure) came to us and said can you go and sit on another table which was in the middle of 2 groups of men so we didn\'t feel comfortable and told them we didn\'t want to go. He argued for a good 10 minutes telling us that a group of 10 people had reserved the porch and we had to leave that table. Anyway, we told them that we\'d order and move if and when the group of 10 people came since we knew that wasn\'t true. Finally got to ordering and ordered 2 appetizers. It took them more than 35 minutes to serve the appetizers. That\'s not even it, they served us appetizers with one plate and one tissue for a group of 4 people! At this point we called the manager and said we\'ve had enough. Their staff was not only unprofessional but really rude as well. We also ordered pizza and we were in shock when we saw a huge pizza dish with a tiny pizza on it (attaching pictures below). They gave us a complimentary brownie which was a sweet gesture on their part but it was dry with stale walnuts.Taste wise appetizers were fine .but whatsup with this crappy service? That is totally not acceptable! Plus we ordered pepperoni pizza with had sausages not pepperoni.

I called them a day before to book a table and asked for some decorations like balloons or maybe a birthday banner. (I had read in a review that they do it complimentary) \nSo when we got there they offered us their party room. There was no decoration rather they just threw two bunches of balloons on the floor. \nWe ordered 6 dishes:\n- Mozzarella sticks (2) which were appetisers but arrived after the main course.\n- Parmesan chicken. \n- Fettuccine Alfredo pasta.\n- Tarragon chicken.\n- Peri peri pizza (peri peri? wasn't spicy at all and the crust was thick and dry). \n\nThere was no proper service. The drinks arrived before the appetiser, next came in the main courses and the appetiser came right after. When I say the food was tasteless, I really do mean it. I've never had such an Alfredo pasta that doesn't even taste like one!? The mozzarella sticks were really flat and broke as we picked them up, they tasted pathetic without the sauce served with them. \nThe pizza was again bland, why would they even name it Peri Peri!? All we could taste was the thick and dry crust because the topping literally had no taste. \n\nI complained to the person who came in to ask about the food. He offered to order something as a takeaway but how was that suppose to make up for the tasteless food? They didn't offer anything complimentary, not even their service! \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\n\nThe total bill was around Rs. 6120, including tax and service charge. We were 7 altogether.""",b'Javeria A.

Turns out because I had paid in advance and foodpanda had received the money he just dropped it at a random house and decided whats the issue, we have already got the money. Finally after numerous messages I got through to foodpanda and they said an hour after dropping the food at some random persons house they will pick it from them and give it back to me. I refused and said now I want a refund as I paid good money for food which could have been treated god knows how by someone random. They said ok we will have it done. 20 minutes very sneakily their rider picks up that same food and drops it at my house. Foodpanda is no longer responding have taken the money and dropped food which could very well have been tampered by someone. It is in an awful state. Came to me after lying outside at some random persons house for 2 hours. Absolute scams foodpanda are.\n\nP.s that's literally how I've received my 10 am breakfast (at almost 2).

Overall nachos were average in taste.\nrate: 6/10\n\n2-  House Ground Beef Burger\nIt was just the very normal dry beef burger, petty was too dry, over all no sauce was complimenting the burger's entire taste. I will not mention other brands but many other small burger joints have great taste as compared to this cafe's burger.\nrate: 3/10\n\n3- The Club Sandwich\nClub sandwich was just ok, I was expecting something different with the taste but it was like Aone's type. So it killed our expectations, we can have two clubs from Aone like these in the same price of which Dialogue is offering.\nrate: 4/10\n\n4- Oven Roasted Chicken\nSame here, this entry also killed our expectations, we expected boneless piece with proper seasoning of rosemary and Parmesan. But both's elements were missing in the taste and it was very normal roasted leg piece without any marination. \nrate: 2/10\n\n5- New Zealand Rib Eye Steak \nI am steak lover, and tried almost every where in Pakistan, I also make steaks at home. When I was ordering the from the steaks section, I asked the waiter which steak is the best in your menu he suggested the most expensive one amoung the others which cost 1400/100grams. I asked the weigh per serving he told 180 to 200grm per serving and I confirmed him the order with mentioning that to keep proper eye on temperature, I ordered medium well. \nDisaster happened when I saw steak in my plate, it was well done of well done, overcooked piece of beef, you can see blackening of both sides in the picture. The cut was not even ribeye, and overall it was too hard. I didn't even touched that steak and returned to them and never asked for new as it was too bad to ruin my mood and my appetite. \nrate: 0/10\n\nOverall ratings: 3.8/10\nHighly not recommended from my side to anyone.\nOver all damage for four items 3,610, steak was cancelled.\nPS: We went to the other place to complete our appetite.\nVisit day: Sunday 5th Feb 2018\nTime: Around 9pm""",b'Saad Qamar Bhatti',"b""Photos from Saad Qamar Bhatti's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155327118371033&set=gm.1807445202639955&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1807445202639955/',2018-02-06 07:16:53,9,0,1,8,1,0,0,0,0

Just one dish , it was beautifully done and looked appealing too , since we all were quite hungry we attacked the plate and it got done within  few minutes, then after another 10 minutes when my dad scolded the guy about bad service and management , he brought the second dish and the rice was pretty cold as if it just came out of the fridge ... if Gordon Ramsey was there he would have sealed the place ! \nIt was at this moment that we all lost our cool ( Im not the kind of guy who gets effed up so easily ) but yes I was furious so I just went to wash my hands and told the waiter "" yaar aplog khaana toh layengay nahi toh bill hi ladain "" to which the waiter took another 15 minutes to generate the BILL and he did that when I threatened him to leave the premises in a minute if he doesn\'t brings the bill... it seemed  like they were weren\'t even interested in collecting the bill. Just during the payment of bill this other customer also lost his temper and things were getting out of control for them, Khair we stood up and went to Desi gali toh eat some bunkababs and boy ! boy ! they were Goood! And then some chai and Nutella paratha to end the day on a good note but yeah golden bowl if you can\'t handle it, it\'s better to shut it down for once and for all ! \nIt\'s just simply not your thing ! \nBest regards,\nOne furious customer \xf0\x9f\xa4\xac'",b'Omer Usman',"b""Photos from Omer Usman's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210552908088203&set=gm.1798865023497973&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1798865023497973/',2018-01-29 02:33:44,16,8,0,14,0,0,2,0,0

Food came an hour late at 9:45 they had misplaced the order. 3 other customers had the same issue regarding food. \nOne table told them to cancel the order and left after waiting an hour. They had come before us! \nOne table waited 20mins for a cake slice. Table behind us were served uncooked noodles. \nThe waiters were running around 'look busy do nothing'. No waiter would listen. When he did come around he said food takes 15-20mins and it had been 30mins already. When the food came it was average similar to chop chop wok. Had I known I would have gone there. We were not compensated in any way. No apology nothing. The manager wouldn't even come out of the kitchen to talk to the customers. We could see him in the kitchen since there were glass windows to show the food NOT BEING COOKED. \n\nBeing a new restaurant I felt there service and management should have been more on point.""",b'Arika Mobeen Paracha',,status,,b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1798662933518182/',2018-01-28 13:41:55,10,5,0,10,0,0,0,0,0

Everything was there in one burger and its definitly a juicy , chessy, messy meaty treat!\n\nTaste 9/10\nValue for money 9/10\nSize 8/10(for the monstrous appetite)""",b'Sohail Kamran',"b""Photos from Sohail Kamran's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215143473520906&set=gm.1769141126470363&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1769141126470363/',2017-12-31 08:44:07,38,18,0,31,2,0,5,0,0

For Rs. 800 the serving size is more than generous, the flavors were melt in your mouth good. Also guys i kid you not when I say this you won't be able to finish it, it's a bit heavy and really really big. Definitely worth trying!

We ordered one Khaousay, one Chicken Cheese Paratha and one plate Gol Gappay. We instructed the waiter to get it made as spicy as possible. \n\nThe Khaousay was nothing less than a bad daliya with noodles, tasteless and flavourless. \nAte half a bowl of it just for the respect of food.\n\nThe chicken cheese paratha had literally no cheese in it. Again it had no flavor or spices. The only thing spicy and tasty enough was the green chatni provided with it.\n\nGol Gappay were made fresh and looked promising with the glass shots. But as we took the first bite of it and drank the sauce. It felt like 'Saunf ka paani'. We asked the waiter to make the sauce more spicy, so he went and brought the same sauce in a bowl.\n\nSo we left them and head to pay the bill. Upon telling the cashier about our experience, he was courteous enough to let go the price of Gol Gappay and said that he will forward our complaint about chicken cheese to the manager.\n\nAlso he gave us the 20% check-in discount they are offering even though we didn't check in.\n\nBut as he gave me the bill, it had the Gol Gappay mentioned and charged again. Upon scrutiny, he said it was a mistake. Rectified it and paid the amount that was around 470.\nBut they still gave me the bill generated earlier with the full amount. (Good luck explaining that to FBR) even though you are not registered yet. \n\nOverall, I would say that they still need improvements in their recipes and even in training their staff.\n\nFood 3/10\nAmbience 7/10\nPresentation 5/10\nOverall 4/10\n\nFinal verdict, won't be going there again.""",b'Hasaan Mir',"b""Photos from Hasaan Mir's post""",photo,b'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1551866994868584&set=gm.1805805079470634&type=3',b'https://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/1805805079470634/',2018-02-05 00:53:53,52,8,0,46,1,0,4,1,0
